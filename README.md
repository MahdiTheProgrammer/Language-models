# Language models
I am learning different language models such as RNN, LSTM, GRU and Transfomers (All you need is attention).
I try to understand the concept and math behind the scenes, then I code and evaluate what I have learned in this repository. 
By now I have done a project with embedding and RNN, LSTM (Film review classification) and now I am studying the math behind the transformers.
