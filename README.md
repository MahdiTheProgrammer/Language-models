# Language models
I am learning different language models such as RNN, LSTM, GRU and Transfomers (All you need is attention).
I try to understand the concept and math behind the scenes, then I code and evaluate what I have learned in this repository. 
By now I have tried embedding and RNN, next step will be LSTM.
