      "It's no use; no use at all. The children won't let me stop telling tales\n",
      "of the Land of Oz. I know lots of other stories, and I hope to tell\n",
      "them, some time or another; but just now my loving tyrants won't allow\n",
      "me. They cry: \"Oz--Oz! more about Oz, Mr. Baum!\" and what can I do but\n",
      "obey their commands?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is Our Book--mine and the children's. For they have flooded me with\n",
      "thousands of suggestions in regard to it, and I have honestly tried to\n",
      "adopt as many of these suggestions as could be fitted into one story.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the wonderful success of \"Ozma of Oz\" it is evident that Dorothy\n",
      "has become a firm fixture in these Oz stories. The little ones all love\n",
      "Dorothy, and as one of my small friends aptly states: \"It isn't a real\n",
      "Oz story without her.\" So here she is again, as sweet and gentle and\n",
      "innocent as ever, I hope, and the heroine of another strange adventure.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were many requests from my little correspondents for \"more about\n",
      "the Wizard.\" It seems the jolly old fellow made hosts of friends in the\n",
      "first Oz book, in spite of the fact that he frankly acknowledged himself\n",
      "\"a humbug.\" The children had heard how he mounted into the sky in a\n",
      "balloon and they were all waiting for him to come down again. So what\n",
      "could I do but tell \"what happened to the Wizard afterward\"? You will\n",
      "find him in these pages, just the same humbug Wizard as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was one thing the children demanded which I found it impossible to\n",
      "do in this present book: they bade me introduce Toto, Dorothy's little\n",
      "black dog, who has many friends among my readers. But you will see, when\n",
      "you begin to read the story, that Toto was in Kansas while Dorothy was\n",
      "in California, and so she had to start on her adventure without him. In\n",
      "this book Dorothy had to take her kitten with her instead of her dog;\n",
      "but in the next Oz book, if I am permitted to write one, I intend to\n",
      "tell a good deal about Toto's further history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Princess Ozma, whom I love as much as my readers do, is again introduced\n",
      "in this story, and so are several of our old friends of Oz. You will\n",
      "also become acquainted with Jim the Cab-Horse, the Nine Tiny Piglets,\n",
      "and Eureka, the Kitten. I am sorry the kitten was not as well behaved as\n",
      "she ought to have been; but perhaps she wasn't brought up properly.\n",
      "Dorothy found her, you see, and who her parents were nobody knows.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe, my dears, that I am the proudest story-teller that ever\n",
      "lived. Many a time tears of pride and joy have stood in my eyes while I\n",
      "read the tender, loving, appealing letters that come to me in almost\n",
      "every mail from my little readers. To have pleased you, to have\n",
      "interested you, to have won your friendship, and perhaps your love,\n",
      "through my stories, is to my mind as great an achievement as to become\n",
      "President of the United States. Indeed, I would much rather be your\n",
      "story-teller, under these conditions, than to be the President. So you\n",
      "have helped me to fulfill my life's ambition, and I am more grateful to\n",
      "you, my dears, than I can express in words.\n",
      "\n",
      "I try to answer every letter of my young correspondents; yet sometimes\n",
      "there are so many letters that a little time must pass before you get\n",
      "your answer. But be patient, friends, for the answer will surely come,\n",
      "and by writing to me you more than repay me for the pleasant task of\n",
      "preparing these books. Besides, I am proud to acknowledge that the books\n",
      "are partly yours, for your suggestions often guide me in telling the\n",

      "The train from 'Frisco was very late. It should have arrived at Hugson's\n",
      "siding at midnight, but it was already five o'clock and the gray dawn\n",
      "was breaking in the east when the little train slowly rumbled up to the\n",
      "open shed that served for the station-house. As it came to a stop the\n",
      "conductor called out in a loud voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hugson's Siding!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At once a little girl rose from her seat and walked to the door of the\n",
      "car, carrying a wicker suit-case in one hand and a round bird-cage\n",
      "covered up with newspapers in the other, while a parasol was tucked\n",
      "under her arm. The conductor helped her off the car and then the\n",
      "engineer started his train again, so that it puffed and groaned and\n",
      "moved slowly away up the track. The reason he was so late was because\n",
      "all through the night there were times when the solid earth shook and\n",
      "trembled under him, and the engineer was afraid that at any moment the\n",
      "rails might spread apart and an accident happen to his passengers. So he\n",
      "moved the cars slowly and with caution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little girl stood still to watch until the train had disappeared\n",
      "around a curve; then she turned to see where she was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shed at Hugson's Siding was bare save for an old wooden bench, and\n",
      "did not look very inviting. As she peered through the soft gray light\n",
      "not a house of any sort was visible near the station, nor was any person\n",
      "in sight; but after a while the child discovered a horse and buggy\n",
      "standing near a group of trees a short distance away. She walked toward\n",
      "it and found the horse tied to a tree and standing motionless, with its\n",
      "head hanging down almost to the ground. It was a big horse, tall and\n",
      "bony, with long legs and large knees and feet. She could count his ribs\n",
      "easily where they showed through the skin of his body, and his head was\n",
      "long and seemed altogether too big for him, as if it did not fit. His\n",
      "tail was short and scraggly, and his harness had been broken in many\n",
      "places and fastened together again with cords and bits of wire. The\n",
      "buggy seemed almost new, for it had a shiny top and side curtains.\n",
      "Getting around in front, so that she could look inside, the girl saw a\n",
      "boy curled up on the seat, fast asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "She set down the bird-cage and poked the boy with her parasol. Presently\n",
      "he woke up, rose to a sitting position and rubbed his eyes briskly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello!\" he said, seeing her, \"are you Dorothy Gale?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" she answered, looking gravely at his tousled hair and blinking\n",
      "gray eyes. \"Have you come to take me to Hugson's Ranch?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" he answered. \"Train in?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I couldn't be here if it wasn't,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He laughed at that, and his laugh was merry and frank. Jumping out of\n",
      "the buggy he put Dorothy's suit-case under the seat and her bird-cage on\n",
      "the floor in front.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Canary-birds?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no; it's just Eureka, my kitten. I thought that was the best way to\n",
      "carry her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eureka's a funny name for a cat,\" he remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I named my kitten that because I found it,\" she explained. \"Uncle Henry\n",
      "says 'Eureka' means 'I have found it.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right; hop in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She climbed into the buggy and he followed her. Then the boy picked up\n",
      "the reins, shook them, and said \"Gid-dap!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The horse did not stir. Dorothy thought he just wiggled one of his\n",
      "drooping ears, but that was all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gid-dap!\" called the boy, again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The horse stood still.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" said Dorothy, \"if you untied him, he would go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy laughed cheerfully and jumped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Guess I'm half asleep yet,\" he said, untying the horse. \"But Jim knows\n",
      "his business all right--don't you, Jim?\" patting the long nose of the\n",
      "animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he got into the buggy again and took the reins, and the horse at\n",
      "once backed away from the tree, turned slowly around, and began to trot\n",
      "down the sandy road which was just visible in the dim light.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thought that train would never come,\" observed the boy. \"I've waited at\n",
      "that station for five hours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We had a lot of earthquakes,\" said Dorothy. \"Didn't you feel the ground\n",
      "shake?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; but we're used to such things in California,\" he replied. \"They\n",

      "[Illustration: DOROTHY POKED THE BOY WITH HER PARASOL.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The conductor said it was the worst quake he ever knew.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did he? Then it must have happened while I was asleep,\" he said,\n",
      "thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is Uncle Henry?\" she enquired, after a pause during which the horse\n",
      "continued to trot with long, regular strides.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's pretty well. He and Uncle Hugson have been having a fine visit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Mr. Hugson your uncle?\" she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. Uncle Bill Hugson married your Uncle Henry's wife's sister; so we\n",
      "must be second cousins,\" said the boy, in an amused tone. \"I work for\n",
      "Uncle Bill on his ranch, and he pays me six dollars a month and my\n",
      "board.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't that a great deal?\" she asked, doubtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's a great deal for Uncle Hugson, but not for me. I'm a splendid\n",
      "worker. I work as well as I sleep,\" he added, with a laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is your name?\" asked Dorothy, thinking she liked the boy's manner\n",
      "and the cheery tone of his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a very pretty one,\" he answered, as if a little ashamed. \"My whole\n",
      "name is Zebediah; but folks just call me 'Zeb.' You've been to\n",
      "Australia, haven't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; with Uncle Henry,\" she answered. \"We got to San Francisco a week\n",
      "ago, and Uncle Henry went right on to Hugson's Ranch for a visit while I\n",
      "stayed a few days in the city with some friends we had met.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How long will you be with us?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only a day. Tomorrow Uncle Henry and I must start back for Kansas.\n",
      "We've been away for a long time, you know, and so we're anxious to get\n",
      "home again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy flicked the big, boney horse with his whip and looked\n",
      "thoughtful. Then he started to say something to his little companion,\n",
      "but before he could speak the buggy began to sway dangerously from side\n",
      "to side and the earth seemed to rise up before them. Next minute there\n",
      "was a roar and a sharp crash, and at her side Dorothy saw the ground\n",
      "open in a wide crack and then come together again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goodness!\" she cried, grasping the iron rail of the seat. \"What was\n",
      "that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was an awful big quake,\" replied Zeb, with a white face. \"It\n",
      "almost got us that time, Dorothy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The horse had stopped short, and stood firm as a rock. Zeb shook the\n",
      "reins and urged him to go, but Jim was stubborn. Then the boy cracked\n",
      "his whip and touched the animal's flanks with it, and after a low moan\n",
      "of protest Jim stepped slowly along the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither the boy nor the girl spoke again for some minutes. There was a\n",
      "breath of danger in the very air, and every few moments the earth would\n",
      "shake violently. Jim's ears were standing erect upon his head and every\n",
      "muscle of his big body was tense as he trotted toward home. He was not\n",
      "going very fast, but on his flanks specks of foam began to appear and at\n",
      "times he would tremble like a leaf.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sky had grown darker again and the wind made queer sobbing sounds as\n",
      "it swept over the valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly there was a rending, tearing sound, and the earth split into\n",
      "another great crack just beneath the spot where the horse was standing.\n",
      "With a wild neigh of terror the animal fell bodily into the pit, drawing\n",
      "the buggy and its occupants after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorothy grabbed fast hold of the buggy top and the boy did the same. The\n",

      "Blackness engulfed them on every side, and in breathless silence they\n",

      "When Dorothy recovered her senses they were still falling, but not so\n",
      "fast. The top of the buggy caught the air like a parachute or an\n",
      "umbrella filled with wind, and held them back so that they floated\n",
      "downward with a gentle motion that was not so very disagreeable to bear.\n",
      "The worst thing was their terror of reaching the bottom of this great\n",
      "crack in the earth, and the natural fear that sudden death was about to\n",
      "overtake them at any moment. Crash after crash echoed far above their\n",
      "heads, as the earth came together where it had split, and stones and\n",
      "chunks of clay rattled around them on every side. These they could not\n",
      "see, but they could feel them pelting the buggy top, and Jim screamed\n",
      "almost like a human being when a stone overtook him and struck his\n",
      "boney body. They did not really hurt the poor horse, because everything\n",
      "was falling together; only the stones and rubbish fell faster than the\n",
      "horse and buggy, which were held back by the pressure of the air, so\n",
      "that the terrified animal was actually more frightened than he was\n",
      "injured.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long this state of things continued Dorothy could not even guess,\n",
      "she was so greatly bewildered. But bye and bye, as she stared ahead into\n",
      "the black chasm with a beating heart, she began to dimly see the form of\n",
      "the horse Jim--his head up in the air, his ears erect and his long legs\n",
      "sprawling in every direction as he tumbled through space. Also, turning\n",
      "her head, she found that she could see the boy beside her, who had until\n",
      "now remained as still and silent as she herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorothy sighed and commenced to breathe easier. She began to realize\n",
      "that death was not in store for her, after all, but that she had merely\n",
      "started upon another adventure, which promised to be just as queer and\n",
      "unusual as were those she had before encountered.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this thought in mind the girl took heart and leaned her head over\n",
      "the side of the buggy to see where the strange light was coming from.\n",
      "Far below her she found six great glowing balls suspended in the air.\n",
      "The central and largest one was white, and reminded her of the sun.\n",
      "Around it were arranged, like the five points of a star, the other five\n",
      "brilliant balls; one being rose colored, one violet, one yellow, one\n",
      "blue and one orange. This splendid group of colored suns sent rays\n",
      "darting in every direction, and as the horse and buggy--with Dorothy and\n",
      "Zeb--sank steadily downward and came nearer to the lights, the rays\n",
      "began to take on all the delicate tintings of a rainbow, growing more\n",
      "and more distinct every moment until all the space was brilliantly\n",
      "illuminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorothy was too dazed to say much, but she watched one of Jim's big ears\n",
      "turn to violet and the other to rose, and wondered that his tail should\n",
      "be yellow and his body striped with blue and orange like the stripes of\n",
      "a zebra. Then she looked at Zeb, whose face was blue and whose hair was\n",
      "pink, and gave a little laugh that sounded a bit nervous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't it funny?\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy was startled and his eyes were big. Dorothy had a green streak\n",
      "through the center of her face where the blue and yellow lights came\n",
      "together, and her appearance seemed to add to his fright.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I--I don't s-s-see any-thing funny--'bout it!\" he stammered.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: HORSE, BUGGY AND ALL FELL SLOWLY.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then the buggy tipped slowly over upon its side, the body of the\n",
      "horse tipping also. But they continued to fall, all together, and the\n",
      "boy and girl had no difficulty in remaining upon the seat, just as they\n",
      "were before. Then they turned bottom side up, and continued to roll\n",
      "slowly over until they were right side up again. During this time Jim\n",
      "struggled frantically, all his legs kicking the air; but on finding\n",
      "himself in his former position the horse said, in a relieved tone of\n",
      "voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, that's better!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorothy and Zeb looked at one another in wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can your horse talk?\" she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never knew him to, before,\" replied the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Those were the first words I ever said,\" called out the horse, who had\n",
      "overheard them, \"and I can't explain why I happened to speak then. This\n",
      "is a nice scrape you've got me into, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As for that, we are in the same scrape ourselves,\" answered Dorothy,\n",
      "cheerfully. \"But never mind; something will happen pretty soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" growled the horse; \"and then we shall be sorry it\n",
      "happened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Zeb gave a shiver. All this was so terrible and unreal that he could not\n",
      "understand it at all, and so had good reason to be afraid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swiftly they drew near to the flaming colored suns, and passed close\n",
      "beside them. The light was then so bright that it dazzled their eyes,\n",
      "and they covered their faces with their hands to escape being blinded.\n",
      "There was no heat in the colored suns, however, and after they had\n",
      "passed below them the top of the buggy shut out many of the piercing\n",
      "rays so that the boy and girl could open their eyes again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've got to come to the bottom some time,\" remarked Zeb, with a deep\n",
      "sigh. \"We can't keep falling forever, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course not,\" said Dorothy. \"We are somewhere in the middle of the\n",
      "earth, and the chances are we'll reach the other side of it before long.\n",
      "But it's a big hollow, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Awful big!\" answered the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're coming to something now,\" announced the horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this they both put their heads over the side of the buggy and looked\n",
      "down. Yes; there was land below them; and not so very far away, either.\n",
      "But they were floating very, very slowly--so slowly that it could no\n",
      "longer be called a fall--and the children had ample time to take heart\n",
      "and look about them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They saw a landscape with mountains and plains, lakes and rivers, very\n",
      "like those upon the earth's surface; but all the scene was splendidly\n",
      "colored by the variegated lights from the six suns. Here and there were\n",
      "groups of houses that seemed made of clear glass, because they sparkled\n",
      "so brightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sure we are in no danger,\" said Dorothy, in a sober voice. \"We are\n",
      "falling so slowly that we can't be dashed to pieces when we land, and\n",
      "this country that we are coming to seems quite pretty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll never get home again, though!\" declared Zeb, with a groan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I'm not so sure of that,\" replied the girl. \"But don't let us worry\n",
      "over such things, Zeb; we can't help ourselves just now, you know, and\n",
      "I've always been told it's foolish to borrow trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy became silent, having no reply to so sensible a speech, and soon\n",
      "both were fully occupied in staring at the strange scenes spread out\n",
      "below them. They seemed to be falling right into the middle of a big\n",
      "city which had many tall buildings with glass domes and sharp-pointed\n",
      "spires. These spires were like great spear-points, and if they tumbled\n",
      "upon one of them they were likely to suffer serious injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim the horse had seen these spires, also, and his ears stood straight\n",
      "up with fear, while Dorothy and Zeb held their breaths in suspense. But\n",
      "no; they floated gently down upon a broad, flat roof, and came to a stop\n",
      "at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Jim felt something firm under his feet the poor beast's legs\n",
      "trembled so much that he could hardly stand; but Zeb at once leaped out\n",
      "of the buggy to the roof, and he was so awkward and hasty that he kicked\n",
      "over Dorothy's birdcage, which rolled out upon the roof so that the\n",
      "bottom came off. At once a pink kitten crept out of the upset cage, sat\n",
      "down upon the glass roof, and yawned and blinked its round eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said Dorothy. \"There's Eureka.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"First time I ever saw a pink cat,\" said Zeb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eureka isn't pink; she's white. It's this queer light that gives her\n",
      "that color.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where's my milk?\" asked the kitten, looking up into Dorothy's face.\n",
      "\"I'm 'most starved to death.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Eureka! Can you talk?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Talk! Am I talking? Good gracious, I believe I am. Isn't it funny?\"\n",
      "asked the kitten.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all wrong,\" said Zeb, gravely. \"Animals ought not to talk. But\n",
      "even old Jim has been saying things since we had our accident.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't see that it's wrong,\" remarked Jim, in his gruff tones. \"At\n",
      "least, it isn't as wrong as some other things. What's going to become of\n",
      "us now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" answered the boy, looking around him curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "The houses of the city were all made of glass, so clear and transparent\n",
      "that one could look through the walls as easily as though a window.\n",
      "Dorothy saw, underneath the roof on which she stood, several rooms used\n",
      "for rest chambers, and even thought she could make out a number of queer\n",
      "forms huddled into the corners of these rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The roof beside them had a great hole smashed through it, and pieces of\n",
      "glass were lying scattered in every direction. A near by steeple had\n",
      "been broken off short and the fragments lay heaped beside it. Other\n",
      "buildings were cracked in places or had corners chipped off from them;\n",
      "but they must have been very beautiful before these accidents had\n",
      "happened to mar their perfection. The rainbow tints from the colored\n",
      "suns fell upon the glass city softly and gave to the buildings many\n",
      "delicate, shifting hues which were very pretty to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not a sound had broken the stillness since the strangers had\n",
      "arrived, except that of their own voices. They began to wonder if there\n",
      "were no people to inhabit this magnificent city of the inner world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly a man appeared through a hole in the roof next to the one they\n",
      "were on and stepped into plain view. He was not a very large man, but\n",
      "was well formed and had a beautiful face--calm and serene as the face of\n",
      "a fine portrait. His clothing fitted his form snugly and was gorgeously\n",
      "colored in brilliant shades of green, which varied as the sunbeams\n",
      "touched them but was not wholly influenced by the solar rays.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man had taken a step or two across the glass roof before he noticed\n",
      "the presence of the strangers; but then he stopped abruptly. There was\n",
      "no expression of either fear or surprise upon his tranquil face, yet he\n",
      "must have been both astonished and afraid; for after his eyes had rested\n",
      "upon the ungainly form of the horse for a moment he walked rapidly to\n",
      "the furthest edge of the roof, his head turned back over his shoulder to\n",
      "gaze at the strange animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look out!\" cried Dorothy, who noticed that the beautiful man did not\n",
      "look where he was going; \"be careful, or you'll fall off!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But he paid no attention to her warning. He reached the edge of the tall\n",
      "roof, stepped one foot out into the air, and walked into space as calmly\n",
      "as if he were on firm ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl, greatly astonished, ran to lean over the edge of the roof, and\n",
      "saw the man walking rapidly through the air toward the ground. Soon he\n",
      "reached the street and disappeared through a glass doorway into one of\n",
      "the glass buildings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How strange!\" she exclaimed, drawing a long breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; but it's lots of fun, if it _is_ strange,\" remarked the small\n",
      "voice of the kitten, and Dorothy turned to find her pet walking in the\n",
      "air a foot or so away from the edge of the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come back, Eureka!\" she called, in distress, \"you'll certainly be\n",
      "killed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have nine lives,\" said the kitten, purring softly as it walked around\n",
      "in a circle and then came back to the roof; \"but I can't lose even one\n",
      "of them by falling in this country, because I really couldn't manage to\n",
      "fall if I wanted to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Does the air bear up your weight?\" asked the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course; can't you see?\" and again the kitten wandered into the air\n",
      "and back to the edge of the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's wonderful!\" said Dorothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suppose we let Eureka go down to the street and get some one to help\n",
      "us,\" suggested Zeb, who had been even more amazed than Dorothy at these\n",
      "strange happenings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps we can walk on the air ourselves,\" replied the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zeb drew back with a shiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wouldn't dare try,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May be Jim will go,\" continued Dorothy, looking at the horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And may be he won't!\" answered Jim. \"I've tumbled through the air long\n",
      "enough to make me contented on this roof.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But we didn't tumble to the roof,\" said the girl; \"by the time we\n",
      "reached here we were floating very slowly, and I'm almost sure we could\n",
      "float down to the street without getting hurt. Eureka walks on the air\n",
      "all right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eureka weighs only about half a pound,\" replied the horse, in a\n",
      "scornful tone, \"while I weigh about half a ton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't weigh as much as you ought to, Jim,\" remarked the girl,\n",
      "shaking her head as she looked at the animal. \"You're dreadfully\n",
      "skinny.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well; I'm old,\" said the horse, hanging his head despondently, \"and\n",
      "I've had lots of trouble in my day, little one. For a good many years I\n",
      "drew a public cab in Chicago, and that's enough to make anyone skinny.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He eats enough to get fat, I'm sure,\" said the boy, gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do I? Can you remember any breakfast that I've had today?\" growled Jim,\n",
      "as if he resented Zeb's speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None of us has had breakfast,\" said the boy; \"and in a time of danger\n",
      "like this it's foolish to talk about eating.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing is more dangerous than being without food,\" declared the horse,\n",
      "with a sniff at the rebuke of his young master; \"and just at present no\n",
      "one can tell whether there are any oats in this queer country or not. If\n",
      "there are, they are liable to be glass oats!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: \"COME ON, JIM! IT'S ALL RIGHT.\"]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"I can see plenty of nice gardens and\n",
      "fields down below us, at the edge of this city. But I wish we could find\n",
      "a way to get to the ground.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why don't you walk down?\" asked Eureka. \"I'm as hungry as the horse is,\n",
      "and I want my milk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you try it, Zeb\" asked the girl, turning to her companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zeb hesitated. He was still pale and frightened, for this dreadful\n",
      "adventure had upset him and made him nervous and worried. But he did not\n",
      "wish the little girl to think him a coward, so he advanced slowly to the\n",
      "edge of the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorothy stretched out a hand to him and Zeb put one foot out and let it\n",
      "rest in the air a little over the edge of the roof. It seemed firm\n",
      "enough to walk upon, so he took courage and put out the other foot.\n",
      "Dorothy kept hold of his hand and followed him, and soon they were both\n",
      "walking through the air, with the kitten frisking beside them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come on, Jim!\" called the boy. \"It's all right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim had crept to the edge of the roof to look over, and being a sensible\n",
      "horse and quite experienced, he made up his mind that he could go where\n",
      "the others did. So, with a snort and a neigh and a whisk of his short\n",
      "tail he trotted off the roof into the air and at once began floating\n",
      "downward to the street. His great weight made him fall faster than the\n",
      "children walked, and he passed them on the way down; but when he came to\n",
      "the glass pavement he alighted upon it so softly that he was not even\n",
      "jarred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, well!\" said Dorothy, drawing a long breath, \"What a strange\n",
      "country this is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "People began to come out of the glass doors to look at the new arrivals,\n",
      "and pretty soon quite a crowd had assembled. There were men and women,\n",
      "but no children at all, and the folks were all beautifully formed and\n",
      "attractively dressed and had wonderfully handsome faces. There was not\n",
      "an ugly person in all the throng, yet Dorothy was not especially pleased\n",
      "by the appearance of these people because their features had no more\n",
      "expression than the faces of dolls. They did not smile nor did they\n",
      "frown, or show either fear or surprise or curiosity or friendliness.\n",
      "They simply stared at the strangers, paying most attention to Jim and\n",
      "Eureka, for they had never before seen either a horse or a cat and the\n",
      "children bore an outward resemblance to themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty soon a man joined the group who wore a glistening star in the\n",
      "dark hair just over his forehead. He seemed to be a person of authority,\n",
      "for the others pressed back to give him room. After turning his composed\n",
      "eyes first upon the animals and then upon the children he said to Zeb,\n",
      "who was a little taller than Dorothy:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me, intruder, was it you who caused the Rain of Stones?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment the boy did not know what he meant by this question. Then,\n",
      "remembering the stones that had fallen with them and passed them long\n",
      "before they had reached this place, he answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir; we didn't cause anything. It was the earthquake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The man with the star stood for a time quietly thinking over this\n",
      "speech. Then he asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is an earthquake?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Zeb, who was still confused. But Dorothy, seeing\n",
      "his perplexity, answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a shaking of the earth. In this quake a big crack opened and we\n",
      "fell through--horse and buggy, and all--and the stones got loose and\n",
      "came down with us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The man with the star regarded her with his calm, expressionless eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Rain of Stones has done much damage to our city,\" he said; \"and we\n",
      "shall hold you responsible for it unless you can prove your innocence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can we do that?\" asked the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That I am not prepared to say. It is your affair, not mine. You must\n",
      "go to the House of the Sorcerer, who will soon discover the truth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is the House of the Sorcerer?\" the girl enquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will lead you to it. Come!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned and walked down the street, and after a moment's hesitation\n",
      "Dorothy caught Eureka in her arms and climbed into the buggy. The boy\n",
      "took his seat beside her and said: \"Gid-dap, Jim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the horse ambled along, drawing the buggy, the people of the glass\n",

      "\n",
      "The doorway of the glass palace was quite big enough for the horse and\n",
      "buggy to enter, so Zeb drove straight through it and the children found\n",
      "themselves in a lofty hall that was very beautiful. The people at once\n",
      "followed and formed a circle around the sides of the spacious room,\n",
      "leaving the horse and buggy and the man with the star to occupy the\n",
      "center of the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come to us, oh, Gwig!\" called the man, in a loud voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly a cloud of smoke appeared and rolled over the floor; then it\n",
      "slowly spread and ascended into the dome, disclosing a strange personage\n",
      "seated upon a glass throne just before Jim's nose. He was formed just as\n",
      "were the other inhabitants of this land and his clothing only differed\n",
      "from theirs in being bright yellow. But he had no hair at all, and all\n",
      "over his bald head and face and upon the backs of his hands grew sharp\n",
      "thorns like those found on the branches of rose-bushes. There was even a\n",
      "thorn upon the tip of his nose and he looked so funny that Dorothy\n",
      "laughed when she saw him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sorcerer, hearing the laugh, looked toward the little girl with\n",
      "cold, cruel eyes, and his glance made her grow sober in an instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why have you dared to intrude your unwelcome persons into the secluded\n",
      "Land of the Mangaboos?\" he asked, sternly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Cause we couldn't help it,\" said Dorothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why did you wickedly and viciously send the Rain of Stones to crack and\n",
      "break our houses?\" he continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We didn't,\" declared the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Prove it!\" cried the Sorcerer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't have to prove it,\" answered Dorothy, indignantly. \"If you had\n",
      "any sense at all you'd known it was the earthquake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We only know that yesterday came a Rain of Stones upon us, which did\n",
      "much damage and injured some of our people. Today came another Rain of\n",
      "Stones, and soon after it you appeared among us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By the way,\" said the man with the star, looking steadily at the\n",
      "Sorcerer, \"you told us yesterday that there would not be a second Rain\n",
      "of Stones. Yet one has just occurred that was even worse than the first.\n",
      "What is your sorcery good for if it cannot tell us the truth?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My sorcery does tell the truth!\" declared the thorn-covered man. \"I\n",
      "said there would be but one Rain of Stones. This second one was a Rain\n",
      "of People-and-Horse-and-Buggy. And some stones came with them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will there be any more Rains?\" asked the man with the star.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, my Prince.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Neither stones nor people?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, my Prince.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you sure?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite sure, my Prince. My sorcery tells me so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then a man came running into the hall and addressed the Prince\n",
      "after making a low bow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More wonders in the air, my Lord,\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately the Prince and all of his people flocked out of the hall\n",
      "into the street, that they might see what was about to happen. Dorothy\n",
      "and Zeb jumped out of the buggy and ran after them, but the Sorcerer\n",
      "remained calmly in his throne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Far up in the air was an object that looked like a balloon. It was not\n",
      "so high as the glowing star of the six colored suns, but was descending\n",
      "slowly through the air--so slowly that at first it scarcely seemed to\n",
      "move.\n",
      "\n",
      "The throng stood still and waited. It was all they could do, for to go\n",
      "away and leave that strange sight was impossible; nor could they hurry\n",
      "its fall in any way. The earth children were not noticed, being so near\n",
      "the average size of the Mangaboos, and the horse had remained in the\n",
      "House of the Sorcerer, with Eureka curled up asleep on the seat of the\n",
      "buggy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gradually the balloon grew bigger, which was proof that it was settling\n",
      "down upon the Land of the Mangaboos. Dorothy was surprised to find how\n",
      "patient the people were, for her own little heart was beating rapidly\n",
      "with excitement. A balloon meant to her some other arrival from the\n",
      "surface of the earth, and she hoped it would be some one able to assist\n",
      "her and Zeb out of their difficulties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an hour the balloon had come near enough for her to see a basket\n",
      "suspended below it; in two hours she could see a head looking over the\n",
      "side of the basket; in three hours the big balloon settled slowly into\n",
      "the great square in which they stood and came to rest on the glass\n",
      "pavement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a little man jumped out of the basket, took off his tall hat, and\n",
      "bowed very gracefully to the crowd of Mangaboos around him. He was quite\n",
      "an old little man, and his head was long and entirely bald.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why,\" cried Dorothy, in amazement, \"it's Oz!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The little man looked toward her and seemed as much surprised as she\n",
      "was. But he smiled and bowed as he answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, my dear; I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Eh? And you are little\n",
      "Dorothy, from Kansas. I remember you very well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who did you say it was?\" whispered Zeb to the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the wonderful Wizard of Oz. Haven't you heard of him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then the man with the star came and stood before the Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir,\" said he, \"why are you here, in the Land of the Mangaboos?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't know what land it was, my son,\" returned the other, with a\n",
      "pleasant smile; \"and, to be honest, I didn't mean to visit you when I\n",
      "started out. I live on top of the earth, your honor, which is far better\n",
      "than living inside it; but yesterday I went up in a balloon, and when I\n",
      "came down I fell into a big crack in the earth, caused by an earthquake.\n",
      "I had let so much gas out of my balloon that I could not rise again,\n",
      "and in a few minutes the earth closed over my head. So I continued to\n",
      "descend until I reached this place, and if you will show me a way to get\n",
      "out of it, I'll go with pleasure. Sorry to have troubled you; but it\n",
      "couldn't be helped.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prince had listened with attention. Said he:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This child, who is from the crust of the earth, like yourself, called\n",
      "you a Wizard. Is not a Wizard something like a Sorcerer?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's better,\" replied Oz, promptly. \"One Wizard is worth three\n",
      "Sorcerers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, you shall prove that,\" said the Prince. \"We Mangaboos have, at the\n",
      "present time, one of the most wonderful Sorcerers that ever was picked\n",
      "from a bush; but he sometimes makes mistakes. Do you ever make\n",
      "mistakes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never!\" declared the Wizard, boldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Oz!\" said Dorothy; \"you made a lot of mistakes when you were in the\n",
      "marvelous Land of Oz.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense!\" said the little man, turning red--although just then a ray\n",
      "of violet sunlight was on his round face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come with me,\" said the Prince to him. \"I wish you to meet our\n",
      "Sorcerer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wizard did not like this invitation, but he could not refuse to\n",
      "accept it. So he followed the Prince into the great domed hall, and\n",
      "Dorothy and Zeb came after them, while the throng of people trooped in\n",
      "also.\n",
      "\n",
      "There sat the thorny Sorcerer in his chair of state, and when the Wizard\n",
      "saw him he began to laugh, uttering comical little chuckles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What an absurd creature!\" he exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He may look absurd,\" said the Prince, in his quiet voice; \"but he is an\n",
      "excellent Sorcerer. The only fault I find with him is that he is so\n",
      "often wrong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am never wrong,\" answered the Sorcerer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only a short time ago you told me there would be no more Rain of Stones\n",
      "or of People,\" said the Prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here is another person descended from the air to prove you were wrong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One person cannot be called 'people,'\" said the Sorcerer. \"If two\n",
      "should come out of the sky you might with justice say I was wrong; but\n",
      "unless more than this one appears I will hold that I was right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very clever,\" said the Wizard, nodding his head as if pleased. \"I am\n",
      "delighted to find humbugs inside the earth, just the same as on top of\n",
      "it. Were you ever with a circus, brother?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said the Sorcerer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You ought to join one,\" declared the little man seriously. \"I belong to\n",
      "Bailum & Barney's Great Consolidated Shows--three rings in one tent and\n",
      "a menagerie on the side. It's a fine aggregation, I assure you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you do?\" asked the Sorcerer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I go up in a balloon, usually, to draw the crowds to the circus. But\n",
      "I've just had the bad luck to come out of the sky, skip the solid earth,\n",
      "and land lower down than I intended. But never mind. It isn't everybody\n",
      "who gets a chance to see your Land of the Gabazoos.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mangaboos,\" said the Sorcerer, correcting him. \"If you are a Wizard you\n",
      "ought to be able to call people by their right names.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I'm a Wizard; you may be sure of that. Just as good a Wizard as you\n",
      "are a Sorcerer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That remains to be seen,\" said the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you are able to prove that you are better,\" said the Prince to the\n",
      "little man, \"I will make you the Chief Wizard of this domain.\n",
      "Otherwise--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What will happen otherwise?\" asked the Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will stop you from living, and forbid you to be planted,\" returned\n",
      "the Prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That does not sound especially pleasant,\" said the little man, looking\n",
      "at the one with the star uneasily. \"But never mind. I'll beat Old\n",
      "Prickly, all right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My name is Gwig,\" said the Sorcerer, turning his heartless, cruel eyes\n",
      "upon his rival. \"Let me see you equal the sorcery I am about to\n",
      "perform.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He waved a thorny hand and at once the tinkling of bells was heard,\n",
      "playing sweet music. Yet, look where she would, Dorothy could discover\n",
      "no bells at all in the great glass hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mangaboo people listened, but showed no great interest. It was one\n",
      "of the things Gwig usually did to prove he was a sorcerer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now was the Wizard's turn, so he smiled upon the assemblage and asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will somebody kindly loan me a hat?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No one did, because the Mangaboos did not wear hats, and Zeb had lost\n",
      "his, somehow, in his flight through the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ahem!\" said the Wizard, \"will somebody please loan me a handkerchief?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But they had no handkerchiefs, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good,\" remarked the Wizard. \"I'll use my own hat, if you please.\n",
      "Now, good people, observe me carefully. You see, there is nothing up my\n",
      "sleeve and nothing concealed about my person. Also, my hat is quite\n",
      "empty.\" He took off his hat and held it upside down, shaking it\n",
      "briskly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me see it,\" said the Sorcerer.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the hat and examined it carefully, returning it afterward to the\n",
      "Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now,\" said the little man, \"I will create something out of nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He placed the hat upon the glass floor, made a pass with his hand, and\n",
      "then removed the hat, displaying a little white piglet no bigger than a\n",
      "mouse, which began to run around here and there and to grunt and squeal\n",
      "in a tiny, shrill voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people watched it intently, for they had never seen a pig before,\n",
      "big or little. The Wizard reached out, caught the wee creature in his\n",
      "hand, and holding its head between one thumb and finger and its tail\n",
      "between the other thumb and finger he pulled it apart, each of the two\n",
      "parts becoming a whole and separate piglet in an instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "He placed one upon the floor, so that it could run around, and pulled\n",
      "apart the other, making three piglets in all; and then one of these was\n",
      "pulled apart, making four piglets. The Wizard continued this surprising\n",
      "performance until nine tiny piglets were running about at his feet, all\n",
      "squealing and grunting in a very comical way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now,\" said the Wizard of Oz, \"having created something from nothing, I\n",
      "will make something nothing again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With this he caught up two of the piglets and pushed them together, so\n",
      "that the two were one. Then he caught up another piglet and pushed it\n",
      "into the first, where it disappeared. And so, one by one, the nine tiny\n",
      "piglets were pushed together until but a single one of the creatures\n",
      "remained. This the Wizard placed underneath his hat and made a mystic\n",
      "sign above it. When he removed his hat the last piglet had disappeared\n",
      "entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little man gave a bow to the silent throng that had watched him, and\n",
      "then the Prince said, in his cold, calm voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are indeed a wonderful Wizard, and your powers are greater than\n",
      "those of my Sorcerer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He will not be a wonderful Wizard long,\" remarked Gwig.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not?\" enquired the Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because I am going to stop your breath,\" was the reply. \"I perceive\n",
      "that you are curiously constructed, and that if you cannot breathe you\n",
      "cannot keep alive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The little man looked troubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How long will it take you to stop my breath?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About five minutes. I'm going to begin now. Watch me carefully.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He began making queer signs and passes toward the Wizard; but the little\n",
      "man did not watch him long. Instead, he drew a leathern case from his\n",
      "pocket and took from it several sharp knives, which he joined together,\n",
      "one after another, until they made a long sword. By the time he had\n",
      "attached a handle to this sword he was having much trouble to breathe,\n",
      "as the charm of the Sorcerer was beginning to take effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the Wizard lost no more time, but leaping forward he raised the sharp\n",
      "sword, whirled it once or twice around his head, and then gave a mighty\n",
      "stroke that cut the body of the Sorcerer exactly in two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorothy screamed and expected to see a terrible sight; but as the two\n",
      "halves of the Sorcerer fell apart on the floor she saw that he had no\n",
      "bones or blood inside of him at all, and that the place where he was cut\n",
      "looked much like a sliced turnip or potato.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, he's vegetable!\" cried the Wizard, astonished.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" said the Prince. \"We are all vegetable, in this country.\n",
      "Are you not vegetable, also?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" answered the Wizard. \"People on top of the earth are all meat.\n",
      "Will your Sorcerer die?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, sir. He is really dead now, and will wither very quickly. So\n",
      "we must plant him at once, that other Sorcerers may grow upon his bush,\"\n",
      "continued the Prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you mean by that?\" asked the little Wizard, greatly puzzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you will accompany me to our public gardens,\" replied the Prince, \"I\n",
      "will explain to you much better than I can here the mysteries of our\n",
      "Vegetable Kingdom.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "After the Wizard had wiped the dampness from his sword and taken it\n",
      "apart and put the pieces into their leathern case again, the man with\n",
      "the star ordered some of his people to carry the two halves of the\n",
      "Sorcerer to the public gardens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim pricked up his ears when he heard they were going to the gardens,\n",
      "and wanted to join the party, thinking he might find something proper to\n",
      "eat; so Zeb put down the top of the buggy and invited the Wizard to ride\n",
      "with them. The seat was amply wide enough for the little man and the two\n",
      "children, and when Jim started to leave the hall the kitten jumped upon\n",
      "his back and sat there quite contentedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the procession moved through the streets, the bearers of the Sorcerer\n",
      "first, the Prince next, then Jim drawing the buggy with the strangers\n",
      "inside of it, and last the crowd of vegetable people who had no hearts\n",
      "and could neither smile nor frown.\n",
      "\n",
      "The glass city had several fine streets, for a good many people lived\n",
      "there; but when the procession had passed through these it came upon a\n",
      "broad plain covered with gardens and watered by many pretty brooks that\n",
      "flowed through it. There were paths through these gardens, and over some\n",
      "of the brooks were ornamental glass bridges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorothy and Zeb now got out of the buggy and walked beside the Prince,\n",
      "so that they might see and examine the flowers and plants better.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who built these lovely bridges?\" asked the little girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No one built them,\" answered the man with the star. \"They grow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's queer,\" said she. \"Did the glass houses in your city grow, too?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" he replied. \"But it took a good many years for them to grow\n",
      "as large and fine as they are now. That is why we are so angry when a\n",
      "Rain of Stones comes to break our towers and crack our roofs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can't you mend them?\" she enquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; but they will grow together again, in time, and we must wait until\n",
      "they do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They first passed through many beautiful gardens of flowers, which grew\n",
      "nearest the city; but Dorothy could hardly tell what kind of flowers\n",
      "they were, because the colors were constantly changing under the\n",
      "shifting lights of the six suns. A flower would be pink one second,\n",
      "white the next, then blue or yellow; and it was the same way when they\n",
      "came to the plants, which had broad leaves and grew close to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they passed over a field of grass Jim immediately stretched down\n",
      "his head and began to nibble.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A nice country this is,\" he grumbled, \"where a respectable horse has to\n",
      "eat pink grass!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's violet,\" said the Wizard, who was in the buggy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now it's blue,\" complained the horse. \"As a matter of fact, I'm eating\n",
      "rainbow grass.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How does it taste?\" asked the Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not bad at all,\" said Jim. \"If they give me plenty of it I'll not\n",
      "complain about its color.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time the party had reached a freshly plowed field, and the\n",
      "Prince said to Dorothy:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is our planting-ground.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Several Mangaboos came forward with glass spades and dug a hole in the\n",
      "ground. Then they put the two halves of the Sorcerer into it and covered\n",
      "him up. After that other people brought water from a brook and sprinkled\n",
      "the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He will sprout very soon,\" said the Prince, \"and grow into a large\n",
      "bush, from which we shall in time be able to pick several very good\n",
      "sorcerers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do all your people grow on bushes?\" asked the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" was the reply. \"Do not all people grow upon bushes where\n",
      "you came from, on the outside of the earth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not that I ever heard of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How strange! But if you will come with me to one of our folk gardens I\n",
      "will show you the way we grow in the Land of the Mangaboos.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared that these odd people, while they were able to walk through\n",
      "the air with ease, usually moved upon the ground in the ordinary way.\n",
      "There were no stairs in their houses, because they did not need them,\n",
      "but on a level surface they generally walked just as we do.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little party of strangers now followed the Prince across a few more\n",
      "of the glass bridges and along several paths until they came to a garden\n",
      "enclosed by a high hedge. Jim had refused to leave the field of grass,\n",
      "where he was engaged in busily eating; so the Wizard got out of the\n",
      "buggy and joined Zeb and Dorothy, and the kitten followed demurely at\n",
      "their heels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the hedge they came upon row after row of large and handsome\n",
      "plants with broad leaves gracefully curving until their points nearly\n",
      "reached the ground. In the center of each plant grew a daintily dressed\n",
      "Mangaboo, for the clothing of all these creatures grew upon them and was\n",
      "attached to their bodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The growing Mangaboos were of all sizes, from the blossom that had just\n",
      "turned into a wee baby to the full-grown and almost ripe man or woman.\n",
      "On some of the bushes might be seen a bud, a blossom, a baby, a\n",
      "half-grown person and a ripe one; but even those ready to pluck were\n",
      "motionless and silent, as if devoid of life. This sight explained to\n",
      "Dorothy why she had seen no children among the Mangaboos, a thing she\n",
      "had until now been unable to account for.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our people do not acquire their real life until they leave their\n",
      "bushes,\" said the Prince. \"You will notice they are all attached to the\n",
      "plants by the soles of their feet, and when they are quite ripe they are\n",
      "easily separated from the stems and at once attain the powers of motion\n",
      "and speech. So while they grow they cannot be said to really live, and\n",
      "they must be picked before they can become good citizens.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How long do you live, after you are picked?\" asked Dorothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That depends upon the care we take of ourselves,\" he replied. \"If we\n",
      "keep cool and moist, and meet with no accidents, we often live for five\n",
      "years. I've been picked over six years, but our family is known to be\n",
      "especially long lived.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you eat?\" asked the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eat! No, indeed. We are quite solid inside our bodies, and have no need\n",
      "to eat, any more than does a potato.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But the potatoes sometimes sprout,\" said Zeb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And sometimes we do,\" answered the Prince; \"but that is considered a\n",
      "great misfortune, for then we must be planted at once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where did you grow?\" asked the Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will show you,\" was the reply. \"Step this way, please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He led them within another but smaller circle of hedge, where grew one\n",
      "large and beautiful bush.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This,\" said he, \"is the Royal Bush of the Mangaboos. All of our Princes\n",
      "and Rulers have grown upon this one bush from time immemorial.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They stood before it in silent admiration. On the central stalk stood\n",
      "poised the figure of a girl so exquisitely formed and colored and so\n",
      "lovely in the expression of her delicate features that Dorothy thought\n",
      "she had never seen so sweet and adorable a creature in all her life.\n",
      "The maiden's gown was soft as satin and fell about her in ample folds,\n",
      "while dainty lace-like traceries trimmed the bodice and sleeves. Her\n",
      "flesh was fine and smooth as polished ivory, and her poise expressed\n",
      "both dignity and grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is this?\" asked the Wizard, curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prince had been staring hard at the girl on the bush. Now he\n",
      "answered, with a touch of uneasiness in his cold tones:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is the Ruler destined to be my successor, for she is a Royal\n",
      "Princess. When she becomes fully ripe I must abandon the sovereignty of\n",
      "the Mangaboos to her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't she ripe now?\" asked Dorothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He hesitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not quite,\" said he, finally. \"It will be several days before she needs\n",
      "to be picked, or at least that is my judgment. I am in no hurry to\n",
      "resign my office and be planted, you may be sure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Probably not,\" declared the Wizard, nodding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is one of the most unpleasant things about our vegetable lives,\"\n",
      "continued the Prince, with a sigh, \"that while we are in our full prime\n",
      "we must give way to another, and be covered up in the ground to sprout\n",
      "and grow and give birth to other people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sure the Princess is ready to be picked,\" asserted Dorothy, gazing\n",
      "hard at the beautiful girl on the bush. \"She's as perfect as she can\n",
      "be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind,\" answered the Prince, hastily, \"she will be all right for a\n",
      "few days longer, and it is best for me to rule until I can dispose of\n",
      "you strangers, who have come to our land uninvited and must be attended\n",
      "to at once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you going to do with us?\" asked Zeb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is a matter I have not quite decided upon,\" was the reply. \"I\n",
      "think I shall keep this Wizard until a new Sorcerer is ready to pick,\n",
      "for he seems quite skillful and may be of use to us. But the rest of you\n",
      "must be destroyed in some way, and you cannot be planted, because I do\n",
      "not wish horses and cats and meat people growing all over our country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You needn't worry,\" said Dorothy. \"We wouldn't grow under ground, I'm\n",
      "sure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why destroy my friends?\" asked the little Wizard. \"Why not let them\n",
      "live?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They do not belong here,\" returned the Prince. \"They have no right to\n",
      "be inside the earth at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We didn't ask to come down here; we fell,\" said Dorothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is no excuse,\" declared the Prince, coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The children looked at each other in perplexity, and the Wizard sighed.\n",
      "Eureka rubbed her paw on her face and said in her soft, purring voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He won't need to destroy _me_, for if I don't get something to eat\n",
      "pretty soon I shall starve to death, and so save him the trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he planted you, he might grow some cat-tails,\" suggested the Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Eureka! perhaps we can find you some milk-weeds to eat,\" said the\n",
      "boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Phoo!\" snarled the kitten; \"I wouldn't touch the nasty things!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't need milk, Eureka,\" remarked Dorothy; \"you are big enough now\n",
      "to eat any kind of food.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I can get it,\" added Eureka.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm hungry myself,\" said Zeb. \"But I noticed some strawberries growing\n",
      "in one of the gardens, and some melons in another place. These people\n",
      "don't eat such things, so perhaps on our way back they will let us get\n",
      "them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind your hunger,\" interrupted the Prince. \"I shall order you\n",
      "destroyed in a few minutes, so you will have no need to ruin our pretty\n",
      "melon vines and berry bushes. Follow me, please, to meet your doom.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "DOROTHY PICKS THE PRINCESS\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The words of the cold and moist vegetable Prince were not very\n",
      "comforting, and as he spoke them he turned away and left the enclosure.\n",
      "The children, feeling sad and despondent, were about to follow him when\n",
      "the Wizard touched Dorothy softly on her shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait!\" he whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What for?\" asked the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suppose we pick the Royal Princess,\" said the Wizard. \"I'm quite sure\n",
      "she's ripe, and as soon as she comes to life she will be the Ruler, and\n",
      "may treat us better than that heartless Prince intends to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right!\" exclaimed Dorothy, eagerly. \"Let's pick her while we have\n",
      "the chance, before the man with the star comes back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So together they leaned over the great bush and each of them seized one\n",
      "hand of the lovely Princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pull!\" cried Dorothy, and as they did so the royal lady leaned toward\n",
      "them and the stems snapped and separated from her feet. She was not at\n",
      "all heavy, so the Wizard and Dorothy managed to lift her gently to the\n",
      "ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beautiful creature passed her hands over her eyes an instant, tucked\n",
      "in a stray lock of hair that had become disarranged, and after a look\n",
      "around the garden made those present a gracious bow and said, in a sweet\n",
      "but even toned voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thank you very much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We salute your Royal Highness!\" cried the Wizard, kneeling and kissing\n",
      "her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then the voice of the Prince was heard calling upon them to hasten,\n",
      "and a moment later he returned to the enclosure, followed by a number of\n",
      "his people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly the Princess turned and faced him, and when he saw that she\n",
      "was picked the Prince stood still and began to tremble.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir,\" said the Royal Lady, with much dignity, \"you have wronged me\n",
      "greatly, and would have wronged me still more had not these strangers\n",
      "come to my rescue. I have been ready for picking all the past week, but\n",
      "because you were selfish and desired to continue your unlawful rule,\n",
      "you left me to stand silent upon my bush.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not know that you were ripe,\" answered the Prince, in a low\n",
      "voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give me the Star of Royalty!\" she commanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly he took the shining star from his own brow and placed it upon\n",
      "that of the Princess. Then all the people bowed low to her, and the\n",
      "Prince turned and walked away alone. What became of him afterward our\n",
      "friends never knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people of Mangaboo now formed themselves into a procession and\n",
      "marched toward the glass city to escort their new ruler to her palace\n",
      "and to perform those ceremonies proper to the occasion. But while the\n",
      "people in the procession walked upon the ground the Princess walked in\n",
      "the air just above their heads, to show that she was a superior being\n",
      "and more exalted than her subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one now seemed to pay any attention to the strangers, so Dorothy and\n",
      "Zeb and the Wizard let the train pass on and then wandered by themselves\n",
      "into the vegetable gardens. They did not bother to cross the bridges\n",
      "over the brooks, but when they came to a stream they stepped high and\n",
      "walked in the air to the other side. This was a very interesting\n",
      "experience to them, and Dorothy said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder why it is that we can walk so easily in the air.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" answered the Wizard, \"it is because we are close to the\n",
      "center of the earth, where the attraction of gravitation is very slight.\n",
      "But I've noticed that many queer things happen in fairy countries.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this a fairy country?\" asked the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course it is,\" returned Dorothy, promptly. \"Only a fairy country\n",
      "could have veg'table people; and only in a fairy country could Eureka\n",
      "and Jim talk as we do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's true,\" said Zeb, thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the vegetable gardens they found the strawberries and melons, and\n",
      "several other unknown but delicious fruits, of which they ate heartily.\n",
      "But the kitten bothered them constantly by demanding milk or meat, and\n",
      "called the Wizard names because he could not bring her a dish of milk by\n",
      "means of his magical arts.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they sat upon the grass watching Jim, who was still busily eating,\n",
      "Eureka said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe you are a Wizard at all!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" answered the little man, \"you are quite right. In the strict sense\n",
      "of the word I am not a Wizard, but only a humbug.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Wizard of Oz has always been a humbug,\" agreed Dorothy. \"I've known\n",
      "him for a long time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If that is so,\" said the boy, \"how could he do that wonderful trick\n",
      "with the nine tiny piglets?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't know,\" said Dorothy, \"but it must have been humbug.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very true,\" declared the Wizard, nodding at her. \"It was necessary to\n",
      "deceive that ugly Sorcerer and the Prince, as well as their stupid\n",
      "people; but I don't mind telling you, who are my friends, that the thing\n",
      "was only a trick.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I saw the little pigs with my own eyes!\" exclaimed Zeb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So did I,\" purred the kitten.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure,\" answered the Wizard. \"You saw them because they were\n",
      "there. They are in my inside pocket now. But the pulling of them apart\n",
      "and pushing them together again was only a sleight-of-hand trick.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's see the pigs,\" said Eureka, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little man felt carefully in his pocket and pulled out the tiny\n",
      "piglets, setting them upon the grass one by one, where they ran around\n",
      "and nibbled the tender blades.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They're hungry, too,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, what cunning things!\" cried Dorothy, catching up one and petting\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be careful!\" said the piglet, with a squeal, \"you're squeezing me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear me!\" murmured the Wizard, looking at his pets in astonishment.\n",
      "\"They can actually talk!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May I eat one of them?\" asked the kitten, in a pleading voice. \"I'm\n",
      "awfully hungry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Eureka,\" said Dorothy, reproachfully, \"what a cruel question! It\n",
      "would be dreadful to eat these dear little things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should say so!\" grunted another of the piglets, looking uneasily at\n",
      "the kitten; \"cats are cruel things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not cruel,\" replied the kitten, yawning. \"I'm just hungry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You cannot eat my piglets, even if you are starving,\" declared the\n",
      "little man, in a stern voice. \"They are the only things I have to prove\n",
      "I'm a wizard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did they happen to be so little?\" asked Dorothy. \"I never saw such\n",
      "small pigs before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are from the Island of Teenty-Weent,\" said the Wizard, \"where\n",
      "everything is small because it's a small island. A sailor brought them\n",
      "to Los Angeles and I gave him nine tickets to the circus for them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what am I going to eat?\" wailed the kitten, sitting in front of\n",
      "Dorothy and looking pleadingly into her face. \"There are no cows here\n",
      "to give milk; or any mice, or even grasshoppers. And if I can't eat the\n",
      "piglets you may as well plant me at once and raise catsup.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have an idea,\" said the Wizard, \"that there are fishes in these\n",
      "brooks. Do you like fish?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fish!\" cried the kitten. \"Do I like fish? Why, they're better than\n",
      "piglets--or even milk!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'll try to catch you some,\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But won't they be veg'table, like everything else here?\" asked the\n",
      "kitten.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think not. Fishes are not animals, and they are as cold and moist as\n",
      "the vegetables themselves. There is no reason, that I can see, why they\n",
      "may not exist in the waters of this strange country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Wizard bent a pin for a hook and took a long piece of string\n",
      "from his pocket for a fish-line. The only bait he could find was a\n",
      "bright red blossom from a flower; but he knew fishes are easy to fool if\n",
      "anything bright attracts their attention, so he decided to try the\n",
      "blossom. Having thrown the end of his line in the water of a nearby\n",
      "brook he soon felt a sharp tug that told him a fish had bitten and was\n",
      "caught on the bent pin; so the little man drew in the string and, sure\n",
      "enough, the fish came with it and was landed safely on the shore,\n",
      "where it began to flop around in great excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: IN THE GARDEN OF THE MANGABOOS.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The fish was fat and round, and its scales glistened like beautifully\n",
      "cut jewels set close together; but there was no time to examine it\n",
      "closely, for Eureka made a jump and caught it between her claws, and in\n",
      "a few moments it had entirely disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Eureka!\" cried Dorothy, \"did you eat the bones?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it had any bones, I ate them,\" replied the kitten, composedly, as it\n",
      "washed its face after the meal. \"But I don't think that fish had any\n",
      "bones, because I didn't feel them scratch my throat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were very greedy,\" said the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was very hungry,\" replied the kitten.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little pigs had stood huddled in a group, watching this scene with\n",
      "frightened eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cats are dreadful creatures!\" said one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad we are not fishes!\" said another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't worry,\" Dorothy murmured, soothingly, \"I'll not let the kitten\n",
      "hurt you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she happened to remember that in a corner of her suit-case were one\n",
      "or two crackers that were left over from her luncheon on the train, and\n",
      "she went to the buggy and brought them. Eureka stuck up her nose at such\n",
      "food, but the tiny piglets squealed delightedly at the sight of the\n",
      "crackers and ate them up in a jiffy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now let us go back to the city,\" suggested the Wizard. \"That is, if Jim\n",

      "ready to go, now, at any time you wish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, after the Wizard had put the piglets back into his inside pocket,\n",
      "where they cuddled up and went to sleep, the three climbed into the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Where shall we stay?\" asked the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I shall take possession of the House of the Sorcerer,\" replied\n",
      "the Wizard; \"for the Prince said in the presence of his people that he\n",
      "would keep me until they picked another Sorcerer, and the new Princess\n",
      "won't know but that we belong there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They agreed to this plan, and when they reached the great square Jim\n",
      "drew the buggy into the big door of the domed hall.\n",

      "\"What are those holes up there?\" enquired the boy, pointing to some\n",
      "openings that appeared near the top of the dome.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They look like doorways,\" said Dorothy; \"only there are no stairs to\n",
      "get to them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You forget that stairs are unnecessary,\" observed the Wizard. \"Let us\n",
      "walk up, and see where the doors lead to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With this he began walking in the air toward the high openings, and\n",
      "Dorothy and Zeb followed him. It was the same sort of climb one\n",
      "experiences when walking up a hill, and they were nearly out of breath\n",
      "when they came to the row of openings, which they perceived to be\n",
      "doorways leading into halls in the upper part of the house. Following\n",
      "these halls they discovered many small rooms opening from them, and some\n",
      "were furnished with glass benches, tables and chairs. But there were no\n",
      "beds at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder if these people never sleep,\" said the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, there seems to be no night at all in this country,\" Zeb replied.\n",
      "\"Those colored suns are exactly in the same place they were when we\n",
      "came, and if there is no sunset there can be no night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very true,\" agreed the Wizard. \"But it is a long time since I have had\n",
      "any sleep, and I'm tired. So I think I shall lie down upon one of these\n",
      "hard glass benches and take a nap.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will, too,\" said Dorothy, and chose a little room at the end of the\n",
      "hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zeb walked down again to unharness Jim, who, when he found himself free,\n",
      "rolled over a few times and then settled down to sleep, with Eureka\n",
      "nestling comfortably beside his big, boney body. Then the boy returned\n",

      "\n",
      "When the Wizard awoke the six colored suns were shining down upon the\n",
      "Land of the Mangaboos just as they had done ever since his arrival. The\n",
      "little man, having had a good sleep, felt rested and refreshed, and\n",
      "looking through the glass partition of the room he saw Zeb sitting up on\n",
      "his bench and yawning. So the Wizard went in to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Zeb,\" said he, \"my balloon is of no further use in this strange\n",
      "country, so I may as well leave it on the square where it fell. But in\n",
      "the basket-car are some things I would like to keep with me. I wish you\n",
      "would go and fetch my satchel, two lanterns, and a can of kerosene oil\n",
      "that is under the seat. There is nothing else that I care about.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the boy went willingly upon the errand, and by the time he had\n",
      "returned Dorothy was awake. Then the three held a counsel to decide what\n",
      "they should do next, but could think of no way to better their\n",
      "condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't like these veg'table people,\" said the little girl. \"They're\n",
      "cold and flabby, like cabbages, in spite of their prettiness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I agree with you. It is because there is no warm blood in them,\"\n",
      "remarked the Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And they have no hearts; so they can't love anyone--not even\n",

      "to go, I'd like to go there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But _is_ there any other place?\" asked the Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" she answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then they heard the big voice of Jim the cab-horse calling to them,\n",
      "and going to the doorway leading to the dome they found the Princess and\n",
      "a throng of her people had entered the House of the Sorcerer.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they went down to greet the beautiful vegetable lady, who said to\n",
      "them:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been talking with my advisors about you meat people, and we have\n",
      "decided that you do not belong in the Land of the Mangaboos and must not\n",
      "remain here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can we go away?\" asked Dorothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you cannot go away, of course; so you must be destroyed,\" was the\n",
      "answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In what way?\" enquired the Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We shall throw you three people into the Garden of the Twining Vines,\"\n",
      "said the Princess, \"and they will soon crush you and devour your bodies\n",
      "to make themselves grow bigger. The animals you have with you we will\n",
      "drive to the mountains and put into the Black Pit. Then our country will\n",
      "be rid of all its unwelcome visitors.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you are in need of a Sorcerer,\" said the Wizard, \"and not one of\n",
      "those growing is yet ripe enough to pick. I am greater than any\n",
      "thorn-covered sorcerer that ever grew in your garden. Why destroy me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is true we need a Sorcerer,\" acknowledged the Princess, \"but I am\n",
      "informed that one of our own will be ready to pick in a few days, to\n",
      "take the place of Gwig, whom you cut in two before it was time for him\n",
      "to be planted. Let us see your arts, and the sorceries you are able to\n",
      "perform. Then I will decide whether to destroy you with the others or\n",
      "not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this the Wizard made a bow to the people and repeated his trick of\n",
      "producing the nine tiny piglets and making them disappear again. He did\n",
      "it very cleverly, indeed, and the Princess looked at the strange\n",
      "piglets as if she were as truly astonished as any vegetable person could\n",
      "be. But afterward she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have heard of this wonderful magic. But it accomplishes nothing of\n",
      "value. What else can you do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wizard tried to think. Then he jointed together the blades of his\n",
      "sword and balanced it very skillfully upon the end of his nose. But even\n",
      "that did not satisfy the Princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then his eye fell upon the lanterns and the can of kerosene oil\n",
      "which Zeb had brought from the car of his balloon, and he got a clever\n",
      "idea from those commonplace things.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your Highness,\" said he, \"I will now proceed to prove my magic by\n",
      "creating two suns that you have never seen before; also I will exhibit a\n",
      "Destroyer much more dreadful than your Clinging Vines.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So he placed Dorothy upon one side of him and the boy upon the other and\n",
      "set a lantern upon each of their heads.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Then, with much dignity and a look of vast importance upon his wrinkled\n",
      "face, the Wizard got out his match-box and lighted the two lanterns. The\n",
      "glare they made was very small when compared with the radiance of the\n",
      "six great colored suns; but still they gleamed steadily and clearly. The\n",
      "Mangaboos were much impressed because they had never before seen any\n",
      "light that did not come directly from their suns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next the Wizard poured a pool of oil from the can upon the glass floor,\n",
      "where it covered quite a broad surface. When he lighted the oil a\n",
      "hundred tongues of flame shot up, and the effect was really imposing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Princess,\" exclaimed the Wizard, \"those of your advisors who\n",
      "wished to throw us into the Garden of Clinging Vines must step within\n",
      "this circle of light. If they advised you well, and were in the right,\n",
      "they will not be injured in any way. But if any advised you wrongly, the\n",
      "light will wither him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The advisors of the Princess did not like this test; but she commanded\n",
      "them to step into the flame and one by one they did so, and were\n",
      "scorched so badly that the air was soon filled with an odor like that of\n",
      "baked potatoes. Some of the Mangaboos fell down and had to be dragged\n",
      "from the fire, and all were so withered that it would be necessary to\n",
      "plant them at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir,\" said the Princess to the Wizard, \"you are greater than any\n",
      "Sorcerer we have ever known. As it is evident that my people have\n",
      "advised me wrongly, I will not cast you three people into the dreadful\n",
      "Garden of the Clinging Vines; but your animals must be driven into the\n",
      "Black Pit in the mountain, for my subjects cannot bear to have them\n",
      "around.\"\n",

      "The Wizard was so pleased to have saved the two children and himself\n",
      "that he said nothing against this decree; but when the Princess had gone\n",
      "both Jim and Eureka protested they did not want to go to the Black Pit,\n",
      "and Dorothy promised she would do all that she could to save them from\n",
      "such a fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "For two or three days after this--if we call days the periods between\n",
      "sleep, there being no night to divide the hours into days--our friends\n",
      "were not disturbed in any way. They were even permitted to occupy the\n",
      "House of the Sorcerer in peace, as if it had been their own, and to\n",
      "wander in the gardens in search of food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once they came near to the enclosed Garden of the Clinging Vines, and\n",
      "walking high into the air looked down upon it with much interest. They\n",
      "saw a mass of tough green vines all matted together and writhing and\n",
      "twisting around like a nest of great snakes. Everything the vines\n",
      "touched they crushed, and our adventurers were indeed thankful to have\n",
      "escaped being cast among them.\n",

      "Whenever the Wizard went to sleep he would take the nine tiny piglets\n",
      "from his pocket and let them run around on the floor of his room to\n",
      "amuse themselves and get some exercise; and one time they found his\n",
      "glass door ajar and wandered into the hall and then into the bottom part\n",
      "of the great dome, walking through the air as easily as Eureka could.\n",
      "They knew the kitten, by this time, so they scampered over to where she\n",
      "lay beside Jim and commenced to frisk and play with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cab-horse, who never slept long at a time, sat upon his haunches and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Don't be rough!\" he would call out, if Eureka knocked over one of the\n",
      "round, fat piglets with her paw; but the pigs never minded, and enjoyed\n",
      "the sport very greatly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly they looked up to find the room filled with the silent,\n",
      "solemn-eyed Mangaboos. Each of the vegetable folks bore a branch covered\n",
      "with sharp thorns, which was thrust defiantly toward the horse, the\n",
      "kitten and the piglets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here--stop this foolishness!\" Jim roared, angrily; but after being\n",
      "pricked once or twice he got upon his four legs and kept out of the way\n",
      "of the thorns.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mangaboos surrounded them in solid ranks, but left an opening to the\n",
      "doorway of the hall; so the animals slowly retreated until they were\n",
      "driven from the room and out upon the street. Here were more of the\n",
      "vegetable people with thorns, and silently they urged the now frightened\n",
      "creatures down the street. Jim had to be careful not to step upon the\n",
      "tiny piglets, who scampered under his feet grunting and squealing, while\n",
      "Eureka, snarling and biting at the thorns pushed toward her, also tried\n",
      "to protect the pretty little things from injury. Slowly but steadily the\n",

      "again and again, charging into the vegetable crowd, knocking them in\n",
      "all directions and sending the others scattering to escape his iron\n",
      "heels. Eureka helped him by flying into the faces of the enemy and\n",

      "\n",
      "Sometimes the tunnel was so narrow that the wheels of the buggy grazed\n",
      "the sides; then it would broaden out as wide as a street; but the floor\n",
      "was usually smooth, and for a long time they travelled on without any\n",
      "accident. Jim stopped sometimes to rest, for the climb was rather steep\n",
      "and tiresome.\n",

      "\n",
      "But they kept steadily moving, and just as Jim was about tired out with\n",
      "his long journey the way suddenly grew lighter, and Zeb put out the\n",
      "lanterns to save the oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "To their joy they found it was a white light that now greeted them, for\n",
      "all were weary of the colored rainbow lights which, after a time, had\n",
      "made their eyes ache with their constantly shifting rays. The sides of\n",
      "the tunnel showed before them like the inside of a long spy-glass, and\n",
      "the floor became more level. Jim hastened his lagging steps at this\n",
      "assurance of a quick relief from the dark passage, and in a few moments\n",
      "more they had emerged from the mountain and found themselves face to\n",
      "face with a new and charming country.\n",

      "THE VALLEY OF VOICES\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By journeying through the glass mountain they had reached a delightful\n",
      "valley that was shaped like the hollow of a great cup, with another\n",
      "rugged mountain showing on the other side of it, and soft and pretty\n",
      "green hills at the ends. It was all laid out into lovely lawns and\n",
      "gardens, with pebble paths leading through them and groves of beautiful\n",
      "and stately trees dotting the landscape here and there. There were\n",
      "orchards, too, bearing luscious fruits that are all unknown in our\n",
      "world. Alluring brooks of crystal water flowed sparkling between their\n",
      "flower-strewn banks, while scattered over the valley were dozens of the\n",
      "quaintest and most picturesque cottages our travelers had ever beheld.\n",
      "None of them were in clusters, such as villages or towns, but each had\n",
      "ample grounds of its own, with orchards and gardens surrounding it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the new arrivals gazed upon this exquisite scene they were enraptured\n",
      "by its beauties and the fragrance that permeated the soft air, which\n",
      "they breathed so gratefully after the confined atmosphere of the tunnel.\n",
      "Several minutes were consumed in silent admiration before they noticed\n",
      "two very singular and unusual facts about this valley. One was that it\n",
      "was lighted from some unseen source; for no sun or moon was in the\n",
      "arched blue sky, although every object was flooded with a clear and\n",
      "perfect light. The second and even more singular fact was the absence of\n",
      "any inhabitant of this splendid place. From their elevated position they\n",
      "could overlook the entire valley, but not a single moving object could\n",
      "they see. All appeared mysteriously deserted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mountain on this side was not glass, but made of a stone similar to\n",
      "granite. With some difficulty and danger Jim drew the buggy over the\n",
      "loose rocks until he reached the green lawns below, where the paths and\n",
      "orchards and gardens began. The nearest cottage was still some distance\n",
      "away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't it fine?\" cried Dorothy, in a joyous voice, as she sprang out of\n",
      "the buggy and let Eureka run frolicking over the velvety grass.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed!\" answered Zeb. \"We were lucky to get away from those\n",
      "dreadful vegetable people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It wouldn't be so bad,\" remarked the Wizard, gazing around him, \"if we\n",
      "were obliged to live here always. We couldn't find a prettier place, I'm\n",
      "sure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the piglets from his pocket and let them run on the grass, and\n",
      "Jim tasted a mouthful of the green blades and declared he was very\n",
      "contented in his new surroundings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can't walk in the air here, though,\" called Eureka, who had tried it\n",
      "and failed; but the others were satisfied to walk on the ground, and the\n",
      "Wizard said they must be nearer the surface of the earth than they had\n",
      "been in the Mangaboo country, for everything was more homelike and\n",
      "natural.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But where are the people?\" asked Dorothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little man shook his bald head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can't imagine, my dear,\" he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "They heard the sudden twittering of a bird, but could not find the\n",
      "creature anywhere. Slowly they walked along the path toward the nearest\n",
      "cottage, the piglets racing and gambolling beside them and Jim pausing\n",
      "at every step for another mouthful of grass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently they came to a low plant which had broad, spreading leaves, in\n",
      "the center of which grew a single fruit about as large as a peach. The\n",
      "fruit was so daintily colored and so fragrant, and looked so appetizing\n",
      "and delicious that Dorothy stopped and exclaimed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it, do you s'pose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The piglets had smelled the fruit quickly, and before the girl could\n",
      "reach out her hand to pluck it every one of the nine tiny ones had\n",
      "rushed in and commenced to devour it with great eagerness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's good, anyway,\" said Zeb, \"or those little rascals wouldn't have\n",
      "gobbled it up so greedily.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where are they?\" asked Dorothy, in astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all looked around, but the piglets had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear me!\" cried the Wizard; \"they must have run away. But I didn't see\n",
      "them go; did you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No!\" replied the boy and the girl, together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here,--piggy, piggy, piggy!\" called their master, anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several squeals and grunts were instantly heard at his feet, but the\n",
      "Wizard could not discover a single piglet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where are you?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, right beside you,\" spoke a tiny voice. \"Can't you see us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: \"ARE THERE REALLY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM?\"]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" answered the little man, in a puzzled tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can see you,\" said another of the piglets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wizard stooped down and put out his hand, and at once felt the small\n",
      "fat body of one of his pets. He picked it up, but could not see what he\n",
      "held.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is very strange,\" said he, soberly. \"The piglets have become\n",
      "invisible, in some curious way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll bet it's because they ate that peach!\" cried the kitten.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It wasn't a peach, Eureka,\" said Dorothy. \"I only hope it wasn't\n",
      "poison.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was fine, Dorothy,\" called one of the piglets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll eat all we can find of them,\" said another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But _we_ mus'n't eat them,\" the Wizard warned the children, \"or we too\n",
      "may become invisible, and lose each other. If we come across another of\n",
      "the strange fruit we must avoid it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Calling the piglets to him he picked them all up, one by one, and put\n",
      "them away in his pocket; for although he could not see them he could\n",
      "feel them, and when he had buttoned his coat he knew they were safe for\n",
      "the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "The travellers now resumed their walk toward the cottage, which they\n",
      "presently reached. It was a pretty place, with vines growing thickly\n",
      "over the broad front porch. The door stood open and a table was set in\n",
      "the front room, with four chairs drawn up to it. On the table were\n",
      "plates, knives and forks, and dishes of bread, meat and fruits. The meat\n",
      "was smoking hot and the knives and forks were performing strange antics\n",
      "and jumping here and there in quite a puzzling way. But not a single\n",
      "person appeared to be in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How funny!\" exclaimed Dorothy, who with Zeb and the Wizard now stood in\n",
      "the doorway.\n",
      "\n",
      "A peal of merry laughter answered her, and the knives and forks fell to\n",
      "the plates with a clatter. One of the chairs pushed back from the table,\n",
      "and this was so astonishing and mysterious that Dorothy was almost\n",
      "tempted to run away in fright.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here are strangers, mama!\" cried the shrill and childish voice of some\n",
      "unseen person.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I see, my dear,\" answered another voice, soft and womanly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you want?\" demanded a third voice, in a stern, gruff accent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, well!\" said the Wizard; \"are there really people in this room?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" replied the man's voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And--pardon me for the foolish question--but, are you all invisible?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely,\" the woman answered, repeating her low, rippling laughter.\n",
      "\"Are you surprised that you are unable to see the people of Voe?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, yes,\" stammered the Wizard. \"All the people I have ever met before\n",
      "were very plain to see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where do you come from, then?\" asked the woman, in a curious tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We belong upon the face of the earth,\" explained the Wizard, \"but\n",
      "recently, during an earthquake, we fell down a crack and landed in the\n",
      "Country of the Mangaboos.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dreadful creatures!\" exclaimed the woman's voice. \"I've heard of them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They walled us up in a mountain,\" continued the Wizard; \"but we found\n",
      "there was a tunnel through to this side, so we came here. It is a\n",
      "beautiful place. What do you call it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is the Valley of Voe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you. We have seen no people since we arrived, so we came to this\n",
      "house to enquire our way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you hungry?\" asked the woman's voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could eat something,\" said Dorothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So could I,\" added Zeb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But we do not wish to intrude, I assure you,\" the Wizard hastened to\n",
      "say.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's all right,\" returned the man's voice, more pleasantly than\n",
      "before. \"You are welcome to what we have.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke the voice came so near to Zeb that he jumped back in alarm.\n",
      "Two childish voices laughed merrily at this action, and Dorothy was sure\n",
      "they were in no danger among such light-hearted folks, even if those\n",
      "folks couldn't be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What curious animal is that which is eating the grass on my lawn?\"\n",
      "enquired the man's voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's Jim,\" said the girl. \"He's a horse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is he good for?\" was the next question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He draws the buggy you see fastened to him, and we ride in the buggy\n",
      "instead of walking,\" she explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can he fight?\" asked the man's voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No! he can kick pretty hard with his heels, and bite a little; but Jim\n",
      "can't 'zactly fight,\" she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then the bears will get him,\" said one of the children's voices.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bears!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"Are these bears here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is the one evil of our country,\" answered the invisible man. \"Many\n",
      "large and fierce bears roam in the Valley of Voe, and when they can\n",
      "catch any of us they eat us up; but as they cannot see us, we seldom get\n",
      "caught.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are the bears invis'ble, too?\" asked the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; for they eat of the dama-fruit, as we all do, and that keeps them\n",
      "from being seen by any eye, whether human or animal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Does the dama-fruit grow on a low bush, and look something like a\n",
      "peach?\" asked the Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" was the reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it makes you invis'ble, why do you eat it?\" Dorothy enquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For two reasons, my dear,\" the woman's voice answered. \"The dama-fruit\n",
      "is the most delicious thing that grows, and when it makes us invisible\n",
      "the bears cannot find us to eat us up. But now, good wanderers, your\n",
      "luncheon is on the table, so please sit down and eat as much as you\n",
      "like.\"\n",

      "The strangers took their seats at the table willingly enough, for they\n",
      "were all hungry and the platters were now heaped with good things to\n",
      "eat. In front of each place was a plate bearing one of the delicious\n",
      "dama-fruit, and the perfume that rose from these was so enticing and\n",
      "sweet that they were sorely tempted to eat of them and become invisible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Dorothy satisfied her hunger with other things, and her companions\n",
      "did likewise, resisting the temptation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you not eat the damas?\" asked the woman's voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't want to get invis'ble,\" answered the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if you remain visible the bears will see you and devour you,\" said\n",
      "a girlish young voice, that belonged to one of the children. \"We who\n",
      "live here much prefer to be invisible; for we can still hug and kiss one\n",
      "another, and are quite safe from the bears.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And we do not have to be so particular about our dress,\" remarked the\n",
      "man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And mama can't tell whether my face is dirty or not!\" added the other\n",
      "childish voice, gleefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I make you wash it, every time I think of it,\" said the mother;\n",
      "\"for it stands to reason your face is dirty, Ianu, whether I can see it\n",
      "or not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorothy laughed and stretched out her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come here, please--Ianu and your sister--and let me feel of you,\" she\n",
      "requested.\n",
      "\n",
      "They came to her willingly, and Dorothy passed her hands over their\n",
      "faces and forms and decided one was a girl of about her own age and the\n",
      "other a boy somewhat smaller. The girl's hair was soft and fluffy and\n",
      "her skin as smooth as satin. When Dorothy gently touched her nose and\n",
      "ears and lips they seemed to be well and delicately formed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I could see you I am sure you would be beautiful,\" she declared.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl laughed, and her mother said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are not vain in the Valley of Voe, because we can not display our\n",
      "beauty, and good actions and pleasant ways are what make us lovely to\n",
      "our companions. Yet we can see and appreciate the beauties of nature,\n",
      "the dainty flowers and trees, the green fields and the clear blue of the\n",
      "sky.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How about the birds and beasts and fishes?\" asked Zeb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The birds we cannot see, because they love to eat of the damas as much\n",
      "as we do; yet we hear their sweet songs and enjoy them. Neither can we\n",
      "see the cruel bears, for they also eat the fruit. But the fishes that\n",
      "swim in our brooks we can see, and often we catch them to eat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It occurs to me you have a great deal to make you happy, even while\n",
      "invisible,\" remarked the Wizard. \"Nevertheless, we prefer to remain\n",
      "visible while we are in your valley.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then Eureka came in, for she had been until now wandering outside\n",
      "with Jim; and when the kitten saw the table set with food she cried out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now you must feed me, Dorothy, for I'm half starved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The children were inclined to be frightened by the sight of the small\n",
      "animal, which reminded them of the bears; but Dorothy reassured them by\n",
      "explaining that Eureka was a pet and could do no harm even if she wished\n",
      "to. Then, as the others had by this time moved away from the table, the\n",
      "kitten sprang upon the chair and put her paws upon the cloth to see what\n",
      "there was to eat. To her surprise an unseen hand clutched her and held\n",
      "her suspended in the air. Eureka was frantic with terror, and tried to\n",
      "scratch and bite, so the next moment she was dropped to the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you see that, Dorothy?\" she gasped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, dear,\" her mistress replied; \"there are people living in this\n",
      "house, although we cannot see them. And you must have better manners,\n",
      "Eureka, or something worse will happen to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She placed a plate of food upon the floor and the kitten ate greedily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give me that nice-smelling fruit I saw on the table,\" she begged, when\n",
      "she had cleaned the plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Those are damas,\" said Dorothy, \"and you must never even taste them,\n",
      "Eureka, or you'll get invis'ble, and then we can't see you at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The kitten gazed wistfully at the forbidden fruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Does it hurt to be invis'ble?\" she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" Dorothy answered; \"but it would hurt me dre'fully to\n",
      "lose you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, I won't touch it,\" decided the kitten; \"but you must keep it\n",
      "away from me, for the smell is very tempting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you tell us, sir or ma'am,\" said the Wizard, addressing the air\n",
      "because he did not quite know where the unseen people stood, \"if there\n",
      "is any way we can get out of your beautiful Valley, and on top of the\n",
      "Earth again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, one can leave the Valley easily enough,\" answered the man's voice;\n",
      "\"but to do so you must enter a far less pleasant country. As for\n",
      "reaching the top of the earth, I have never heard that it is possible to\n",
      "do that, and if you succeeded in getting there you would probably fall\n",
      "off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said Dorothy, \"we've been there, and we know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Valley of Voe is certainly a charming place,\" resumed the Wizard;\n",
      "\"but we cannot be contented in any other land than our own, for long.\n",
      "Even if we should come to unpleasant places on our way it is necessary,\n",
      "in order to reach the earth's surface, to keep moving on toward it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In that case,\" said the man, \"it will be best for you to cross our\n",
      "Valley and mount the spiral staircase inside the Pyramid Mountain. The\n",
      "top of that mountain is lost in the clouds, and when you reach it you\n",
      "will be in the awful Land of Naught, where the Gargoyles live.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are Gargoyles?\" asked Zeb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know, young sir. Our greatest Champion, Overman-Anu, once\n",
      "climbed the spiral stairway and fought nine days with the Gargoyles\n",
      "before he could escape them and come back; but he could never be induced\n",
      "to describe the dreadful creatures, and soon afterward a bear caught\n",
      "him and ate him up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The wanderers were rather discouraged by this gloomy report, but Dorothy\n",

      "can be plainly seen by all eyes. When the Champion killed a bear\n",
      "everyone could see it; and when the bears killed the Champion we all saw\n",

      "after the man had called their attention to a high, pyramid-shaped\n",

      "They followed the course of a broad stream and passed several more\n",
      "pretty cottages; but of course they saw no one, nor did any one speak to\n",
      "them. Fruits and flowers grew plentifully all about, and there were many\n",
      "of the delicious damas that the people of Voe were so fond of.\n",
      "\n",
      "About noon they stopped to allow Jim to rest in the shade of a pretty\n",
      "orchard, and while they plucked and ate some of the cherries and plums\n",
      "that grew there a soft voice suddenly said to them:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are bears near by. Be careful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wizard got out his sword at once, and Zeb grabbed the horse-whip.\n",

      "people of Voe usually walk upon the water when we travel, and so escape\n",
      "our enemies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you!\" cried the Wizard, joyfully, and at once rubbed a leaf upon\n",
      "the soles of Dorothy's shoes and then upon his own. The girl took a leaf\n",
      "and rubbed it upon the kitten's paws, and the rest of the plant was\n",
      "handed to Zeb, who, after applying it to his own feet, carefully rubbed\n",
      "it upon all four of Jim's hoofs and then upon the tires of the\n",
      "buggy-wheels. He had nearly finished this last task when a low growling\n",
      "was suddenly heard and the horse began to jump around and kick viciously\n",
      "with his heels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quick! To the water, or you are lost!\" cried their unseen friend, and\n",
      "without hesitation the Wizard drew the buggy down the bank and out upon\n",
      "the broad river, for Dorothy was still seated in it with Eureka in her\n",
      "arms. They did not sink at all, owing to the virtues of the strange\n",
      "plant they had used, and when the buggy was in the middle of the stream\n",
      "the Wizard returned to the bank to assist Zeb and Jim.\n",
      "\n",
      "The horse was plunging madly about, and two or three deep gashes\n",
      "appeared upon its flanks, from which the blood flowed freely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Run for the river!\" shouted the Wizard, and Jim quickly freed himself\n",
      "from his unseen tormenters by a few vicious kicks and then obeyed. As\n",
      "soon as he trotted out upon the surface of the river he found himself\n",
      "safe from pursuit, and Zeb was already running across the water toward\n",
      "Dorothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the little Wizard turned to follow them he felt a hot breath against\n",
      "his cheek and heard a low, fierce growl. At once he began stabbing at\n",
      "the air with his sword, and he knew that he had struck some substance\n",
      "because when he drew back the blade it was dripping with blood. The\n",
      "third time that he thrust out the weapon there was a loud roar and a\n",
      "fall, and suddenly at his feet appeared the form of a great red bear,\n",
      "which was nearly as big as the horse and much stronger and fiercer. The\n",
      "beast was quite dead from the sword thrusts, and after a glance at its\n",
      "terrible claws and sharp teeth the little man turned in a panic and\n",
      "rushed out upon the water, for other menacing growls told him more bears\n",
      "were near.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the river, however, the adventurers seemed to be perfectly safe.\n",
      "Dorothy and the buggy had floated slowly down stream with the current of\n",
      "the water, and the others made haste to join her. The Wizard opened his\n",
      "satchel and got out some sticking-plaster with which he mended the cuts\n",
      "Jim had received from the claws of the bears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think we'd better stick to the river, after this,\" said Dorothy. \"If\n",
      "our unknown friend hadn't warned us, and told us what to do, we would\n",
      "all be dead by this time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is true,\" agreed the Wizard, \"and as the river seems to be flowing\n",
      "in the direction of the Pyramid Mountain it will be the easiest way for\n",
      "us to travel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Zeb hitched Jim to the buggy again, and the horse trotted along and drew\n",
      "them rapidly over the smooth water. The kitten was at first dreadfully\n",
      "afraid of getting wet, but Dorothy let her down and soon Eureka was\n",
      "frisking along beside the buggy without being scared a bit. Once a\n",
      "little fish swam too near the surface, and the kitten grabbed it in her\n",
      "mouth and ate it up as quick as a wink; but Dorothy cautioned her to be\n",
      "careful what she ate in this valley of enchantments, and no more fishes\n",
      "were careless enough to swim within reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a journey of several hours they came to a point where the river\n",
      "curved, and they found they must cross a mile or so of the Valley before\n",
      "they came to the Pyramid Mountain. There were few houses in this part,\n",
      "and few orchards or flowers; so our friends feared they might encounter\n",
      "more of the savage bears, which they had learned to dread with all their\n",
      "hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll have to make a dash, Jim,\" said the Wizard, \"and run as fast as\n",
      "you can go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right,\" answered the horse; \"I'll do my best. But you must remember\n",
      "I'm old, and my dashing days are past and gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All three got into the buggy and Zeb picked up the reins, though Jim\n",
      "needed no guidance of any sort. The horse was still smarting from the\n",
      "sharp claws of the invisible bears, and as soon as he was on land and\n",
      "headed toward the mountain the thought that more of those fearsome\n",
      "creatures might be near acted as a spur and sent him galloping along in\n",
      "a way that made Dorothy catch her breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Zeb, in a spirit of mischief, uttered a growl like that of the\n",
      "bears, and Jim pricked up his ears and fairly flew. His boney legs moved\n",
      "so fast they could scarcely be seen, and the Wizard clung fast to the\n",
      "seat and yelled \"Whoa!\" at the top of his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I--I'm 'fraid he's--he's running away!\" gasped Dorothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I _know_ he is,\" said Zeb; \"but no bear can catch him if he keeps up\n",
      "that gait--and the harness or the buggy don't break.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim did not make a mile a minute; but almost before they were aware of\n",
      "it he drew up at the foot of the mountain, so suddenly that the Wizard\n",
      "and Zeb both sailed over the dashboard and landed in the soft\n",
      "grass--where they rolled over several times before they stopped.\n",
      "Dorothy nearly went with them, but she was holding fast to the iron rail\n",
      "of the seat, and that saved her. She squeezed the kitten, though, until\n",
      "it screeched; and then the old cab-horse made several curious sounds\n",
      "that led the little girl to suspect he was laughing at them all.\n",

      "The mountain before them was shaped like a cone and was so tall that its\n",
      "point was lost in the clouds. Directly facing the place where Jim had\n",
      "stopped was an arched opening leading to a broad stairway. The stairs\n",
      "were cut in the rock inside the mountain, and they were broad and not\n",
      "very steep, because they circled around like a cork-screw, and at the\n",
      "arched opening where the flight began the circle was quite big. At the\n",
      "foot of the stairs was a sign reading:\n",
      "\n",
      "        WARNING.\n",
      "  These steps lead to the\n",

      "said Dorothy, gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No trouble at all,\" declared the horse, with a contemptuous neigh.\n",
      "\"Still, I don't care to drag any passengers. You'll all have to walk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suppose the stairs get steeper?\" suggested Zeb, doubtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you'll have to boost the buggy-wheels, that's all,\" answered Jim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll try it, anyway,\" said the Wizard. \"It's the only way to get out\n",
      "of the Valley of Voe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So they began to ascend the stairs, Dorothy and the Wizard first, Jim\n",
      "next, drawing the buggy, and then Zeb to watch that nothing happened to\n",
      "the harness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light was dim, and soon they mounted into total darkness, so that\n",
      "the Wizard was obliged to get out his lanterns to light the way. But\n",
      "this enabled them to proceed steadily until they came to a landing where\n",
      "there was a rift in the side of the mountain that let in both light and\n",
      "air. Looking through this opening they could see the Valley of Voe lying\n",
      "far below them, the cottages seeming like toy houses from that distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "After resting a few moments they resumed their climb, and still the\n",
      "stairs were broad and low enough for Jim to draw the buggy easily after\n",
      "him. The old horse panted a little, and had to stop often to get his\n",
      "breath. At such times they were all glad to wait for him, for\n",
      "continually climbing up stairs is sure to make one's legs ache.\n",
      "\n",
      "They wound about, always going upward, for some time. The lights from\n",
      "the lanterns dimly showed the way, but it was a gloomy journey, and they\n",
      "were pleased when a broad streak of light ahead assured them they were\n",
      "coming to a second landing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here one side of the mountain had a great hole in it, like the mouth of\n",
      "a cavern, and the stairs stopped at the near edge of the floor and\n",
      "commenced ascending again at the opposite edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opening in the mountain was on the side opposite to the Valley of\n",
      "Voe, and our travellers looked out upon a strange scene. Below them was\n",
      "a vast space, at the bottom of which was a black sea with rolling\n",
      "billows, through which little tongues of flame constantly shot up. Just\n",
      "above them, and almost on a level with their platform, were banks of\n",
      "rolling clouds which constantly shifted position and changed color. The\n",
      "blues and greys were very beautiful, and Dorothy noticed that on the\n",
      "cloud banks sat or reclined fleecy, shadowy forms of beautiful beings\n",
      "who must have been the Cloud Fairies. Mortals who stand upon the earth\n",
      "and look up at the sky cannot often distinguish these forms, but our\n",
      "friends were now so near to the clouds that they observed the dainty\n",
      "fairies very clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are they real?\" asked Zeb, in an awed voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" replied Dorothy, softly. \"They are the Cloud Fairies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They seem like open-work,\" remarked the boy, gazing intently. \"If I\n",
      "should squeeze one, there wouldn't be anything left of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the open space between the clouds and the black, bubbling sea far\n",
      "beneath, could be seen an occasional strange bird winging its way\n",
      "swiftly through the air. These birds were of enormous size, and reminded\n",
      "Zeb of the rocs he had read about in the Arabian Nights. They had fierce\n",
      "eyes and sharp talons and beaks, and the children hoped none of them\n",
      "would venture into the cavern.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I declare!\" suddenly exclaimed the little Wizard. \"What in the\n",
      "world is this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They turned around and found a man standing on the floor in the center\n",
      "of the cave, who bowed very politely when he saw he had attracted their\n",
      "attention. He was a very old man, bent nearly double; but the queerest\n",
      "thing about him was his white hair and beard. These were so long that\n",
      "they reached to his feet, and both the hair and the beard were\n",
      "carefully plaited into many braids, and the end of each braid fastened\n",
      "with a bow of colored ribbon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where did you come from?\" asked Dorothy, wonderingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No place at all,\" answered the man with the braids; \"that is, not\n",
      "recently. Once I lived on top the earth, but for many years I have had\n",
      "my factory in this spot--half way up Pyramid Mountain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are we only half way up?\" enquired the boy, in a discouraged tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe so, my lad,\" replied the braided man. \"But as I have never\n",
      "been in either direction, down or up, since I arrived, I cannot be\n",
      "positive whether it is exactly half way or not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you a factory in this place?\" asked the Wizard, who had been\n",
      "examining the strange personage carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure,\" said the other. \"I am a great inventor, you must know, and\n",
      "I manufacture my products in this lonely spot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are your products?\" enquired the Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I make Assorted Flutters for flags and bunting, and a superior\n",
      "grade of Rustles for ladies' silk gowns.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought so,\" said the Wizard, with a sigh. \"May we examine some of\n",
      "these articles?\"\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed; come into my shop, please,\" and the braided man turned and\n",
      "led the way into a smaller cave, where he evidently lived. Here, on a\n",
      "broad shelf, were several card-board boxes of various sizes, each tied\n",
      "with cotton cord.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This,\" said the man, taking up a box and handling it gently, \"contains\n",
      "twelve dozen rustles--enough to last any lady a year. Will you buy it,\n",
      "my dear?\" he asked, addressing Dorothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My gown isn't silk,\" she said, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind. When you open the box the rustles will escape, whether you\n",
      "are wearing a silk dress or not,\" said the man, seriously. Then he\n",
      "picked up another box. \"In this,\" he continued, \"are many assorted\n",
      "flutters. They are invaluable to make flags flutter on a still day, when\n",
      "there is no wind. You, sir,\" turning to the Wizard, \"ought to have this\n",
      "assortment. Once you have tried my goods I am sure you will never be\n",
      "without them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have no money with me,\" said the Wizard, evasively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not want money,\" returned the braided man, \"for I could not spend\n",
      "it in this deserted place if I had it. But I would like very much a blue\n",
      "hair-ribbon. You will notice my braids are tied with yellow, pink,\n",
      "brown, red, green, white and black; but I have no blue ribbons.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll get you one!\" cried Dorothy, who was sorry for the poor man; so\n",
      "she ran back to the buggy and took from her suit-case a pretty blue\n",
      "ribbon. It did her good to see how the braided man's eyes sparkled when\n",
      "he received this treasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have made me very, very happy, my dear!\" he exclaimed; and then he\n",
      "insisted on the Wizard taking the box of flutters and the little girl\n",
      "accepting the box of rustles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may need them, some time,\" he said, \"and there is really no use in\n",
      "my manufacturing these things unless somebody uses them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why did you leave the surface of the earth?\" enquired the Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could not help it. It is a sad story, but if you will try to restrain\n",
      "your tears I will tell you about it. On earth I was a manufacturer of\n",
      "Imported Holes for American Swiss Cheese, and I will acknowledge that I\n",
      "supplied a superior article, which was in great demand. Also I made\n",
      "pores for porous plasters and high-grade holes for doughnuts and\n",
      "buttons. Finally I invented a new Adjustable Post-hole, which I thought\n",
      "would make my fortune. I manufactured a large quantity of these\n",
      "post-holes, and having no room in which to store them I set them all end\n",
      "to end and put the top one in the ground. That made an extraordinary\n",
      "long hole, as you may imagine, and reached far down into the earth; and,\n",
      "as I leaned over it to try to see to the bottom, I lost my balance and\n",
      "tumbled in. Unfortunately, the hole led directly into the vast space you\n",
      "see outside this mountain; but I managed to catch a point of rock that\n",
      "projected from this cavern, and so saved myself from tumbling headlong\n",
      "into the black waves beneath, where the tongues of flame that dart out\n",
      "would certainly have consumed me. Here, then, I made my home; and\n",
      "although it is a lonely place I amuse myself making rustles and\n",
      "flutters, and so get along very nicely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the braided man had completed this strange tale Dorothy nearly\n",
      "laughed, because it was all so absurd; but the Wizard tapped his\n",
      "forehead significantly, to indicate that he thought the poor man was\n",
      "crazy. So they politely bade him good day, and went back to the outer\n",

      "Another breathless climb brought our adventurers to a third landing\n",
      "where there was a rift in the mountain. On peering out all they could\n",
      "see was rolling banks of clouds, so thick that they obscured all else.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the travellers were obliged to rest, and while they were sitting on\n",
      "the rocky floor the Wizard felt in his pocket and brought out the nine\n",
      "tiny piglets. To his delight they were now plainly visible, which proved\n",
      "that they had passed beyond the influence of the magical Valley of Voe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, we can see each other again!\" cried one, joyfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" sighed Eureka; \"and I also can see you again, and the sight\n",
      "makes me dreadfully hungry. Please, Mr. Wizard, may I eat just one of\n",
      "the fat little piglets? You'd never miss _one_ of them, I'm sure!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a horrid, savage beast!\" exclaimed a piglet; \"and after we've been\n",
      "such good friends, too, and played with one another!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I'm not hungry, I love to play with you all,\" said the kitten,\n",
      "demurely; \"but when my stomach is empty it seems that nothing would fill\n",
      "it so nicely as a fat piglet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And we trusted you so!\" said another of the nine, reproachfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And thought you were respectable!\" said another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It seems we were mistaken,\" declared a third, looking at the kitten\n",
      "timorously, \"no one with such murderous desires should belong to our\n",
      "party, I'm sure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see, Eureka,\" remarked Dorothy, reprovingly, \"you are making\n",
      "yourself disliked. There are certain things proper for a kitten to eat;\n",
      "but I never heard of a kitten eating a pig, under _any_ cir'stances.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you ever see such little pigs before?\" asked the kitten. \"They are\n",
      "no bigger than mice, and I'm sure mice are proper for me to eat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't the bigness, dear; its the variety,\" replied the girl. \"These\n",
      "are Mr. Wizard's pets, just as you are my pet, and it wouldn't be any\n",
      "more proper for you to eat them than it would be for Jim to eat you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And that's just what I shall do if you don't let those little balls of\n",
      "pork alone,\" said Jim, glaring at the kitten with his round, big eyes.\n",
      "\"If you injure any one of them I'll chew you up instantly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The kitten looked at the horse thoughtfully, as if trying to decide\n",
      "whether he meant it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In that case,\" she said, \"I'll leave them alone. You haven't many teeth\n",
      "left, Jim, but the few you have are sharp enough to make me shudder. So\n",
      "the piglets will be perfectly safe, hereafter, as far as I am\n",
      "concerned.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is right, Eureka,\" remarked the Wizard, earnestly. \"Let us all be\n",
      "a happy family and love one another.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Eureka yawned and stretched herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've always loved the piglets,\" she said; \"but they don't love me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No one can love a person he's afraid of,\" asserted Dorothy. \"If you\n",
      "behave, and don't scare the little pigs, I'm sure they'll grow very fond\n",
      "of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wizard now put the nine tiny ones back into his pocket and the\n",
      "journey was resumed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must be pretty near the top, now,\" said the boy, as they climbed\n",
      "wearily up the dark, winding stairway.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Country of the Gurgles can't be far from the top of the earth,\"\n",
      "remarked Dorothy. \"It isn't very nice down here. I'd like to get home\n",
      "again, I'm sure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No one replied to this, because they found they needed all their breath\n",
      "for the climb. The stairs had become narrower and Zeb and the Wizard\n",
      "often had to help Jim pull the buggy from one step to another, or keep\n",
      "it from jamming against the rocky walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, however, a dim light appeared ahead of them, which grew clearer\n",
      "and stronger as they advanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank goodness we're nearly there!\" panted the little Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim, who was in advance, saw the last stair before him and stuck his\n",
      "head above the rocky sides of the stairway. Then he halted, ducked down\n",
      "and began to back up, so that he nearly fell with the buggy onto the\n",
      "others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's go down again!\" he said, in his hoarse voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense!\" snapped the tired Wizard. \"What's the matter with you, old\n",
      "man?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everything,\" grumbled the horse. \"I've taken a look at this place, and\n",
      "it's no fit country for real creatures to go to. Everything's dead, up\n",
      "there--no flesh or blood or growing thing anywhere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind; we can't turn back,\" said Dorothy; \"and we don't intend to\n",
      "stay there, anyhow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's dangerous,\" growled Jim, in a stubborn tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See here, my good steed,\" broke in the Wizard, \"little Dorothy and I\n",
      "have been in many queer countries in our travels, and always escaped\n",
      "without harm. We've even been to the marvelous Land of Oz--haven't we,\n",
      "Dorothy?--so we don't much care what the Country of the Gargoyles is\n",
      "like. Go ahead, Jim, and whatever happens we'll make the best of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right,\" answered the horse; \"this is your excursion, and not mine;\n",
      "so if you get into trouble don't blame me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With this speech he bent forward and dragged the buggy up the remaining\n",
      "steps. The others followed and soon they were all standing upon a broad\n",
      "platform and gazing at the most curious and startling sight their eyes\n",
      "had ever beheld.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Country of the Gargoyles is all wooden!\" exclaimed Zeb; and so it\n",
      "was. The ground was sawdust and the pebbles scattered around were hard\n",
      "knots from trees, worn smooth in course of time. There were odd wooden\n",
      "houses, with carved wooden flowers in the front yards. The tree-trunks\n",
      "were of coarse wood, but the leaves of the trees were shavings. The\n",
      "patches of grass were splinters of wood, and where neither grass nor\n",
      "sawdust showed was a solid wooden flooring. Wooden birds fluttered\n",
      "among the trees and wooden cows were browsing upon the wooden grass; but\n",
      "the most amazing things of all were the wooden people--the creatures\n",
      "known as Gargoyles.\n",
      "\n",
      "These were very numerous, for the palace was thickly inhabited, and a\n",
      "large group of the queer people clustered near, gazing sharply upon the\n",
      "strangers who had emerged from the long spiral stairway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gargoyles were very small of stature, being less than three feet in\n",
      "height. Their bodies were round, their legs short and thick and their\n",
      "arms extraordinarily long and stout. Their heads were too big for their\n",
      "bodies and their faces were decidedly ugly to look upon. Some had long,\n",
      "curved noses and chins, small eyes and wide, grinning mouths. Others had\n",
      "flat noses, protruding eyes, and ears that were shaped like those of an\n",
      "elephant. There were many types, indeed, scarcely two being alike; but\n",
      "all were equally disagreeable in appearance. The tops of their heads had\n",
      "no hair, but were carved into a variety of fantastic shapes, some having\n",
      "a row of points or balls around the top, other designs resembling\n",
      "flowers or vegetables, and still others having squares that looked like\n",
      "waffles cut criss-cross on their heads. They all wore short wooden wings\n",
      "which were fastened to their wooden bodies by means of wooden hinges\n",
      "with wooden screws, and with these wings they flew swiftly and\n",
      "noiselessly here and there, their legs being of little use to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "This noiseless motion was one of the most peculiar things about the\n",
      "Gargoyles. They made no sounds at all, either in flying or trying to\n",
      "speak, and they conversed mainly by means of quick signals made with\n",
      "their wooden fingers or lips. Neither was there any sound to be heard\n",
      "anywhere throughout the wooden country. The birds did not sing, nor did\n",
      "the cows moo; yet there was more than ordinary activity everywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "The group of these queer creatures which was discovered clustered near\n",
      "the stairs at first remained staring and motionless, glaring with evil\n",
      "eyes at the intruders who had so suddenly appeared in their land. In\n",
      "turn the Wizard and the children, the horse and the kitten, examined the\n",
      "Gargoyles with the same silent attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's going to be trouble, I'm sure,\" remarked the horse. \"Unhitch\n",
      "those tugs, Zeb, and set me free from the buggy, so I can fight\n",
      "comfortably.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jim's right,\" sighed the Wizard. \"There's going to be trouble, and my\n",
      "sword isn't stout enough to cut up those wooden bodies--so I shall have\n",
      "to get out my revolvers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He got his satchel from the buggy and, opening it, took out two deadly\n",
      "looking revolvers that made the children shrink back in alarm just to\n",
      "look at.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What harm can the Gurgles do?\" asked Dorothy. \"They have no weapons to\n",
      "hurt us with.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Each of their arms is a wooden club,\" answered the little man, \"and I'm\n",
      "sure the creatures mean mischief, by the looks of their eyes. Even these\n",
      "revolvers can merely succeed in damaging a few of their wooden bodies,\n",
      "and after that we will be at their mercy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why fight at all, in that case?\" asked the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I may die with a clear conscience,\" returned the Wizard, gravely.\n",
      "\"It's every man's duty to do the best he knows how; and I'm going to do\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wish I had an axe,\" said Zeb, who by now had unhitched the horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If we had known we were coming we might have brought along several\n",
      "other useful things,\" responded the Wizard. \"But we dropped into this\n",
      "adventure rather unexpectedly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gargoyles had backed away a distance when they heard the sound of\n",
      "talking, for although our friends had spoken in low tones their words\n",
      "seemed loud in the silence surrounding them. But as soon as the\n",
      "conversation ceased the grinning, ugly creatures arose in a flock and\n",
      "flew swiftly toward the strangers, their long arms stretched out before\n",
      "them like the bowsprits of a fleet of sail-boats. The horse had\n",
      "especially attracted their notice, because it was the biggest and\n",
      "strangest creature they had ever seen; so it became the center of their\n",
      "first attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jim was ready for them, and when he saw them coming he turned his\n",
      "heels toward them and began kicking out as hard as he could. Crack!\n",
      "crash! bang! went his iron-shod hoofs against the wooden bodies of the\n",
      "Gargoyles, and they were battered right and left with such force that\n",
      "they scattered like straws in the wind. But the noise and clatter seemed\n",
      "as dreadful to them as Jim's heels, for all who were able swiftly turned\n",
      "and flew away to a great distance. The others picked themselves up from\n",
      "the ground one by one and quickly rejoined their fellows, so for a\n",
      "moment the horse thought he had won the fight with ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Wizard was not so confident.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Those wooden things are impossible to hurt,\" he said, \"and all the\n",
      "damage Jim has done to them is to knock a few splinters from their noses\n",
      "and ears. That cannot make them look any uglier, I'm sure, and it is my\n",
      "opinion they will soon renew the attack.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What made them fly away?\" asked Dorothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The noise, of course. Don't you remember how the Champion escaped them\n",
      "by shouting his battle-cry?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suppose we escape down the stairs, too,\" suggested the boy. \"We have\n",
      "time, just now, and I'd rather face the invis'ble bears than those\n",
      "wooden imps.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" returned Dorothy, stoutly, \"it won't do to go back, for then we\n",
      "would never get home. Let's fight it out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is what I advise,\" said the Wizard. \"They haven't defeated us yet,\n",
      "and Jim is worth a whole army.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Gargoyles were clever enough not to attack the horse the next\n",
      "time. They advanced in a great swarm, having been joined by many more of\n",
      "their kind, and they flew straight over Jim's head to where the others\n",
      "were standing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wizard raised one of his revolvers and fired into the throng of his\n",
      "enemies, and the shot resounded like a clap of thunder in that silent\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the wooden beings fell flat upon the ground, where they quivered\n",
      "and trembled in every limb; but most of them managed to wheel and escape\n",
      "again to a distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zeb ran and picked up one of the Gargoyles that lay nearest to him. The\n",
      "top of its head was carved into a crown and the Wizard's bullet had\n",
      "struck it exactly in the left eye, which was a hard wooden knot. Half of\n",
      "the bullet stuck in the wood and half stuck out, so it had been the jar\n",
      "and the sudden noise that had knocked the creature down, more than the\n",
      "fact that it was really hurt. Before this crowned Gargoyle had recovered\n",
      "himself Zeb had wound a strap several times around its body, confining\n",
      "its wings and arms so that it could not move. Then, having tied the\n",
      "wooden creature securely, the boy buckled the strap and tossed his\n",
      "prisoner into the buggy. By that time the others had all retired.\n",

      "A WONDERFUL ESCAPE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For a while the enemy hesitated to renew the attack. Then a few of them\n",
      "advanced until another shot from the Wizard's revolver made them\n",
      "retreat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's fine,\" said Zeb. \"We've got 'em on the run now, sure enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But only for a time,\" replied the Wizard, shaking his head gloomily.\n",
      "\"These revolvers are good for six shots each, but when those are gone we\n",
      "shall be helpless.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gargoyles seemed to realize this, for they sent a few of their band\n",
      "time after time to attack the strangers and draw the fire from the\n",
      "little man's revolvers. In this way none of them was shocked by the\n",
      "dreadful report more than once, for the main band kept far away and\n",
      "each time a new company was sent into the battle. When the Wizard had\n",
      "fired all of his twelve bullets he had caused no damage to the enemy\n",
      "except to stun a few by the noise, and so he was no nearer to victory\n",
      "than in the beginning of the fray.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: THE WIZARD FIRED INTO THE THRONG.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall we do now?\" asked Dorothy, anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's yell--all together,\" said Zeb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And fight at the same time,\" added the Wizard. \"We will get near Jim,\n",
      "so that he can help us, and each one must take some weapon and do the\n",
      "best he can. I'll use my sword, although it isn't much account in this\n",
      "affair. Dorothy must take her parasol and open it suddenly when the\n",
      "wooden folks attack her. I haven't anything for you, Zeb.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll use the king,\" said the boy, and pulled his prisoner out of the\n",
      "buggy. The bound Gargoyle's arms extended far out beyond its head, so by\n",
      "grasping its wrists Zeb found the king made a very good club. The boy\n",
      "was strong for one of his years, having always worked upon a farm; so he\n",
      "was likely to prove more dangerous to the enemy than the Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the next company of Gargoyles advanced, our adventurers began\n",
      "yelling as if they had gone mad. Even the kitten gave a dreadfully\n",
      "shrill scream and at the same time Jim the cab-horse neighed loudly.\n",
      "This daunted the enemy for a time, but the defenders were soon out of\n",
      "breath. Perceiving this, as well as the fact that there were no more of\n",
      "the awful \"bangs\" to come from the revolvers, the Gargoyles advanced in\n",
      "a swarm as thick as bees, so that the air was filled with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorothy squatted upon the ground and put up her parasol, which nearly\n",
      "covered her and proved a great protection. The Wizard's sword-blade\n",
      "snapped into a dozen pieces at the first blow he struck against the\n",
      "wooden people. Zeb pounded away with the Gargoyle he was using as a club\n",
      "until he had knocked down dozens of foes; but at the last they clustered\n",
      "so thickly about him that he no longer had room in which to swing his\n",
      "arms. The horse performed some wonderful kicking and even Eureka\n",
      "assisted when she leaped bodily upon the Gargoyles and scratched and bit\n",
      "at them like a wild-cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "But all this bravery amounted to nothing at all. The wooden things wound\n",
      "their long arms around Zeb and the Wizard and held them fast. Dorothy\n",
      "was captured in the same way, and numbers of the Gargoyles clung to\n",
      "Jim's legs, so weighting him down that the poor beast was helpless.\n",
      "Eureka made a desperate dash to escape and scampered along the ground\n",
      "like a streak; but a grinning Gargoyle flew after her and grabbed her\n",
      "before she had gone very far.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of them expected nothing less than instant death; but to their\n",
      "surprise the wooden creatures flew into the air with them and bore them\n",
      "far away, over miles and miles of wooden country, until they came to a\n",
      "wooden city. The houses of this city had many corners, being square and\n",
      "six-sided and eight-sided. They were tower-like in shape and the best of\n",
      "them seemed old and weather-worn; yet all were strong and substantial.\n",
      "\n",
      "To one of these houses which had neither doors nor windows, but only one\n",
      "broad opening far up underneath the roof, the prisoners were brought by\n",
      "their captors. The Gargoyles roughly pushed them into the opening, where\n",
      "there was a platform, and then flew away and left them. As they had no\n",
      "wings the strangers could not fly away, and if they jumped down from\n",
      "such a height they would surely be killed. The creatures had sense\n",
      "enough to reason that way, and the only mistake they made was in\n",
      "supposing the earth people were unable to overcome such ordinary\n",
      "difficulties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim was brought with the others, although it took a good many Gargoyles\n",
      "to carry the big beast through the air and land him on the high\n",
      "platform, and the buggy was thrust in after him because it belonged to\n",
      "the party and the wooden folks had no idea what it was used for or\n",
      "whether it was alive or not. When Eureka's captor had thrown the kitten\n",
      "after the others the last Gargoyle silently disappeared, leaving our\n",
      "friends to breathe freely once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What an awful fight!\" said Dorothy, catching her breath in little\n",
      "gasps.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't know,\" purred Eureka, smoothing her ruffled fur with her\n",
      "paw; \"we didn't manage to hurt anybody, and nobody managed to hurt us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank goodness we are together again, even if we are prisoners,\" sighed\n",
      "the little girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder why they didn't kill us on the spot,\" remarked Zeb, who had\n",
      "lost his king in the struggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are probably keeping us for some ceremony,\" the Wizard answered,\n",
      "reflectively; \"but there is no doubt they intend to kill us as dead as\n",
      "possible in a short time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As dead as poss'ble would be pretty dead, wouldn't it?\" asked Dorothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, my dear. But we have no need to worry about that just now. Let us\n",
      "examine our prison and see what it is like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The space underneath the roof, where they stood, permitted them to see\n",
      "on all sides of the tall building, and they looked with much curiosity\n",
      "at the city spread out beneath them. Everything visible was made of\n",
      "wood, and the scene seemed stiff and extremely unnatural.\n",
      "\n",
      "From their platform a stair descended into the house, and the children\n",
      "and the Wizard explored it after lighting a lantern to show them the\n",
      "way. Several stories of empty rooms rewarded their search, but nothing\n",
      "more; so after a time they came back to the platform again. Had there\n",
      "been any doors or windows in the lower rooms, or had not the boards of\n",
      "the house been so thick and stout, escape would have been easy; but to\n",
      "remain down below was like being in a cellar or the hold of a ship, and\n",
      "they did not like the darkness or the damp smell.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this country, as in all others they had visited underneath the\n",
      "earth's surface, there was no night, a constant and strong light coming\n",
      "from some unknown source. Looking out, they could see into some of the\n",
      "houses near them, where there were open windows in abundance, and were\n",
      "able to mark the forms of the wooden Gargoyles moving about in their\n",
      "dwellings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This seems to be their time of rest,\" observed the Wizard. \"All people\n",
      "need rest, even if they are made of wood, and as there is no night here\n",
      "they select a certain time of the day in which to sleep or doze.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I feel sleepy myself,\" remarked Zeb, yawning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, where's Eureka?\" cried Dorothy, suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all looked around, but the kitten was no place to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's gone out for a walk,\" said Jim, gruffly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where? On the roof?\" asked the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; she just dug her claws into the wood and climbed down the sides of\n",
      "this house to the ground.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She couldn't climb _down_, Jim,\" said Dorothy. \"To climb means to go\n",
      "up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who said so?\" demanded the horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My school-teacher said so; and she knows a lot, Jim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To 'climb down' is sometimes used as a figure of speech,\" remarked the\n",
      "Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, this was a figure of a cat,\" said Jim, \"and she _went_ down,\n",
      "anyhow, whether she climbed or crept.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear me! how careless Eureka is,\" exclaimed the girl, much distressed.\n",
      "\"The Gurgles will get her, sure!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ha, ha!\" chuckled the old cab-horse; \"they're not 'Gurgles,' little\n",
      "maid; they're Gargoyles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind; they'll get Eureka, whatever they're called.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No they won't,\" said the voice of the kitten, and Eureka herself\n",
      "crawled over the edge of the platform and sat down quietly upon the\n",
      "floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wherever have you been, Eureka?\" asked Dorothy, sternly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Watching the wooden folks. They're too funny for anything, Dorothy.\n",
      "Just now they are all going to bed, and--what do you think?--they unhook\n",
      "the hinges of their wings and put them in a corner until they wake up\n",
      "again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What, the hinges?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; the wings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That,\" said Zeb, \"explains why this house is used by them for a prison.\n",
      "If any of the Gargoyles act badly, and have to be put in jail, they are\n",
      "brought here and their wings unhooked and taken away from them until\n",
      "they promise to be good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wizard had listened intently to what Eureka had said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish we had some of those loose wings,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Could we fly with them?\" asked Dorothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think so. If the Gargoyles can unhook the wings then the power to fly\n",
      "lies in the wings themselves, and not in the wooden bodies of the people\n",
      "who wear them. So, if we had the wings, we could probably fly as well as\n",
      "they do--at least while we are in their country and under the spell of\n",
      "its magic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how would it help us to be able to fly?\" questioned the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come here,\" said the little man, and took her to one of the corners of\n",
      "the building. \"Do you see that big rock standing on the hillside\n",
      "yonder?\" he continued, pointing with his finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; it's a good way off, but I can see it,\" she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, inside that rock, which reaches up into the clouds, is an archway\n",
      "very much like the one we entered when we climbed the spiral stairway\n",
      "from the Valley of Voe. I'll get my spy-glass, and then you can see it\n",
      "more plainly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He fetched a small but powerful telescope, which had been in his\n",
      "satchel, and by its aid the little girl clearly saw the opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where does it lead to?\" she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That I cannot tell,\" said the Wizard; \"but we cannot now be far below\n",
      "the earth's surface, and that entrance may lead to another stairway that\n",
      "will bring us on top of our world again, where we belong. So, if we had\n",
      "the wings, and could escape the Gargoyles, we might fly to that rock and\n",
      "be saved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll get you the wings,\" said Zeb, who had thoughtfully listened to all\n",
      "this. \"That is, if the kitten will show me where they are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how can you get down?\" enquired the girl, wonderingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "For answer Zeb began to unfasten Jim's harness, strap by strap, and\n",
      "to buckle one piece to another until he had made a long leather strip\n",
      "that would reach to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: THE FIGHT WITH THE GARGOYLES.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can climb down that, all right,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No you can't,\" remarked Jim, with a twinkle in his round eyes. \"You may\n",
      "_go_ down, but you can only _climb_ up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'll climb up when I get back, then,\" said the boy, with a laugh.\n",
      "\"Now, Eureka, you'll have to show me the way to those wings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must be very quiet,\" warned the kitten; \"for if you make the least\n",
      "noise the Gargoyles will wake up. They can hear a pin drop.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not going to drop a pin,\" said Zeb.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had fastened one end of the strap to a wheel of the buggy, and now he\n",
      "let the line dangle over the side of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be careful,\" cautioned Dorothy, earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will,\" said the boy, and let himself slide over the edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl and the Wizard leaned over and watched Zeb work his way\n",
      "carefully downward, hand over hand, until he stood upon the ground\n",
      "below. Eureka clung with her claws to the wooden side of the house and\n",
      "let herself down easily. Then together they crept away to enter the low\n",
      "doorway of a neighboring dwelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The watchers waited in breathless suspense until the boy again appeared,\n",
      "his arms now full of the wooden wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came to where the strap was hanging he tied the wings all in a\n",
      "bunch to the end of the line, and the Wizard drew them up. Then the line\n",
      "was let down again for Zeb to climb up by. Eureka quickly followed him,\n",
      "and soon they were all standing together upon the platform, with eight\n",
      "of the much prized wooden wings beside them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy was no longer sleepy, but full of energy and excitement. He put\n",
      "the harness together again and hitched Jim to the buggy. Then, with the\n",
      "Wizard's help, he tried to fasten some of the wings to the old\n",
      "cab-horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was no easy task, because half of each one of the hinges of the\n",
      "wings was missing, it being still fastened to the body of the Gargoyle\n",
      "who had used it. However, the Wizard went once more to his\n",
      "satchel--which seemed to contain a surprising variety of odds and\n",
      "ends--and brought out a spool of strong wire, by means of which they\n",
      "managed to fasten four of the wings to Jim's harness, two near his head\n",
      "and two near his tail. They were a bit wiggley, but secure enough if\n",
      "only the harness held together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other four wings were then fastened to the buggy, two on each side,\n",
      "for the buggy must bear the weight of the children and the Wizard as it\n",
      "flew through the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: JIM FLUTTERED AND FLOUNDERED THROUGH THE AIR.]\n",
      "\n",
      "These preparations had not consumed a great deal of time, but the\n",
      "sleeping Gargoyles were beginning to wake up and move around, and soon\n",
      "some of them would be hunting for their missing wings. So the prisoners\n",
      "resolved to leave their prison at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "They mounted into the buggy, Dorothy holding Eureka safe in her lap. The\n",
      "girl sat in the middle of the seat, with Zeb and the Wizard on each side\n",
      "of her. When all was ready the boy shook the reins and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fly away, Jim!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which wings must I flop first?\" asked the cab-horse, undecidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Flop them all together,\" suggested the Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some of them are crooked,\" objected the horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind; we will steer with the wings on the buggy,\" said Zeb. \"Just\n",
      "you light out and make for that rock, Jim; and don't waste any time\n",
      "about it, either.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the horse gave a groan, flopped its four wings all together, and flew\n",
      "away from the platform. Dorothy was a little anxious about the success\n",
      "of their trip, for the way Jim arched his long neck and spread out his\n",
      "bony legs as he fluttered and floundered through the air was enough to\n",
      "make anybody nervous. He groaned, too, as if frightened, and the wings\n",
      "creaked dreadfully because the Wizard had forgotten to oil them; but\n",
      "they kept fairly good time with the wings of the buggy, so that they\n",
      "made excellent progress from the start. The only thing that anyone could\n",
      "complain of with justice was the fact that they wobbled first up and\n",
      "then down, as if the road were rocky instead of being as smooth as the\n",
      "air could make it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main point, however, was that they flew, and flew swiftly, if a bit\n",
      "unevenly, toward the rock for which they had headed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the Gargoyles saw them, presently, and lost no time in\n",
      "collecting a band to pursue the escaping prisoners; so that when Dorothy\n",
      "happened to look back she saw them coming in a great cloud that almost\n",

      "\"But, I'm afraid they'll catch us yet,\" said Dorothy, greatly excited.\n",

      "\n",
      "They tore off the wings, for which they had no further use, and the\n",
      "Wizard piled them in a heap just outside the entrance to the cavern.\n",
      "Then he poured over them all the kerosene oil that was left in his\n",
      "oil-can, and lighting a match set fire to the pile.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flames leaped up at once and the bonfire began to smoke and roar and\n",
      "crackle just as the great army of wooden Gargoyles arrived. The\n",
      "creatures drew back at once, being filled with fear and horror; for such\n",
      "a dreadful thing as a fire they had never before known in all the\n",
      "history of their wooden land.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the archway were several doors, leading to different rooms built\n",
      "into the mountain, and Zeb and the Wizard lifted these wooden doors from\n",
      "their hinges and tossed them all on the flames.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will prove a barrier for some time to come,\" said the little man,\n",
      "smiling pleasantly all over his wrinkled face at the success of their\n",
      "stratagem. \"Perhaps the flames will set fire to all that miserable\n",
      "wooden country, and if it does the loss will be very small and the\n",
      "Gargoyles never will be missed. But come, my children; let us explore\n",
      "the mountain and discover which way we must go in order to escape from\n",
      "this cavern, which is getting to be almost as hot as a bake-oven.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To their disappointment there was within this mountain no regular flight\n",
      "of steps by means of which they could mount to the earth's surface. A\n",
      "sort of inclined tunnel led upward for a way, and they found the floor\n",
      "of it both rough and steep. Then a sudden turn brought them to a narrow\n",
      "gallery where the buggy could not pass. This delayed and bothered them\n",
      "for a while, because they did not wish to leave the buggy behind them.\n",
      "It carried their baggage and was useful to ride in wherever there were\n",
      "good roads, and since it had accompanied them so far in their travels\n",
      "they felt it their duty to preserve it. So Zeb and the Wizard set to\n",
      "work and took off the wheels and the top, and then they put the buggy\n",
      "edgewise, so it would take up the smallest space. In this position they\n",
      "managed, with the aid of the patient cab-horse, to drag the vehicle\n",
      "through the narrow part of the passage. It was not a great distance,\n",
      "fortunately, and when the path grew broader they put the buggy together\n",
      "again and proceeded more comfortably. But the road was nothing more than\n",
      "a series of rifts or cracks in the mountain, and it went zig-zag in\n",
      "every direction, slanting first up and then down until they were puzzled\n",
      "as to whether they were any nearer to the top of the earth than when\n",
      "they had started, hours before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anyhow,\" said Dorothy, \"we've 'scaped those awful Gurgles, and that's\n",
      "_one_ comfort!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Probably the Gargoyles are still busy trying to put out the fire,\"\n",

      "would be very difficult for them to fly amongst these rocks; so I am\n",
      "sure we need fear them no longer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Once in a while they would come to a deep crack in the floor, which made\n",
      "the way quite dangerous; but there was still enough oil in the lanterns\n",
      "to give them light, and the cracks were not so wide but that they were\n",
      "able to jump over them. Sometimes they had to climb over heaps of loose\n",
      "rock, where Jim could scarcely drag the buggy. At such times Dorothy,\n",
      "Zeb and the Wizard all pushed behind, and lifted the wheels over the\n",
      "roughest places; so they managed, by dint of hard work, to keep going.\n",
      "But the little party was both weary and discouraged when at last, on\n",
      "turning a sharp corner, the wanderers found themselves in a vast cave\n",
      "arching high over their heads and having a smooth, level floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cave was circular in shape, and all around its edge, near to the\n",
      "ground, appeared groups of dull yellow lights, two of them being always\n",
      "side by side. These were motionless at first, but soon began to flicker\n",
      "more brightly and to sway slowly from side to side and then up and down.\n",

      "\n",

      "pet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I simply can't describe 'em,\" answered the kitten, shuddering. \"Their\n",
      "eyes are like pie-plates and their mouths like coal-scuttles. But their\n",
      "bodies don't seem very big.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where are they?\" enquired the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are in little pockets all around the edge of this cavern. Oh,\n",
      "Dorothy--you can't imagine what horrid things they are! They're uglier\n",
      "than the Gargoyles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tut-tut! be careful how you criticise your neighbors,\" spoke a rasping\n",
      "voice near by. \"As a matter of fact you are rather ugly-looking\n",
      "creatures yourselves, and I'm sure mother has often told us we were the\n",
      "loveliest and prettiest things in all the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing these words our friends turned in the direction of the sound,\n",
      "and the Wizard held his lanterns so that their light would flood one of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's a dragon!\" he exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" answered the owner of the big yellow eyes which were blinking at\n",
      "them so steadily; \"you are wrong about that. We hope to grow to be\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What's that?\" asked Dorothy, gazing fearfully at the great scaley head,\n",
      "the yawning mouth and the big eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Young dragons, of course; but we are not allowed to call ourselves real\n",
      "dragons until we get our full growth,\" was the reply. \"The big dragons\n",
      "are very proud, and don't think children amount to much; but mother says\n",
      "that some day we will all be very powerful and important.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is your mother?\" asked the Wizard, anxiously looking around.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She has gone up to the top of the earth to hunt for our dinner. If she\n",
      "has good luck she will bring us an elephant, or a brace of rhinoceri, or\n",
      "perhaps a few dozen people to stay our hunger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh; are you hungry?\" enquired Dorothy, drawing back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very,\" said the dragonette, snapping its jaws.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And--and--do you eat people?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure, when we can get them. But they've been very scarce for a\n",
      "few years and we usually have to be content with elephants or\n",
      "buffaloes,\" answered the creature, in a regretful tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How old are you?\" enquired Zeb, who stared at the yellow eyes as if\n",
      "fascinated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite young, I grieve to say; and all of my brothers and sisters that\n",
      "you see here are practically my own age. If I remember rightly, we were\n",
      "sixty-six years old the day before yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But that isn't young!\" cried Dorothy, in amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No?\" drawled the dragonette; \"it seems to me very babyish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How old is your mother?\" asked the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother's about two thousand years old; but she carelessly lost track of\n",
      "her age a few centuries ago and skipped several hundreds. She's a little\n",
      "fussy, you know, and afraid of growing old, being a widow and still in\n",
      "her prime.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should think she would be,\" agreed Dorothy. Then, after a moment's\n",
      "thought, she asked: \"Are we friends or enemies? I mean, will you be good\n",
      "to us, or do you intend to eat us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As for that, we dragonettes would love to eat you, my child; but\n",
      "unfortunately mother has tied all our tails around the rocks at the back\n",
      "of our individual caves, so that we can not crawl out to get you. If you\n",

      "all the other dragonettes sighed dismally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorothy felt relieved. Presently she asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why did your mother tie your tails?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, she is sometimes gone for several weeks on her hunting trips, and\n",
      "if we were not tied we would crawl all over the mountain and fight with\n",
      "each other and get into a lot of mischief. Mother usually knows what she\n",
      "is about, but she made a mistake this time; for you are sure to escape\n",
      "us unless you come too near, and you probably won't do that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed!\" said the little girl. \"We don't wish to be eaten by such\n",
      "awful beasts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Permit me to say,\" returned the dragonette, \"that you are rather\n",
      "impolite to call us names, knowing that we cannot resent your insults.\n",
      "We consider ourselves very beautiful in appearance, for mother has told\n",
      "us so, and she knows. And we are of an excellent family and have a\n",
      "pedigree that I challenge any humans to equal, as it extends back about\n",
      "twenty thousand years, to the time of the famous Green Dragon of\n",
      "Atlantis, who lived in a time when humans had not yet been created. Can\n",
      "you match that pedigree, little girl?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Dorothy, \"I was born on a farm in Kansas, and I guess\n",
      "that's being just as 'spectable and haughty as living in a cave with\n",
      "your tail tied to a rock. If it isn't I'll have to stand it, that's\n",
      "all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tastes differ,\" murmured the dragonette, slowly drooping its scaley\n",
      "eyelids over its yellow eyes, until they looked like half-moons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being reassured by the fact that the creatures could not crawl out of\n",
      "their rock-pockets, the children and the Wizard now took time to examine\n",
      "them more closely. The heads of the dragonettes were as big as barrels\n",
      "and covered with hard, greenish scales that glittered brightly under the\n",
      "light of the lanterns. Their front legs, which grew just back of their\n",
      "heads, were also strong and big; but their bodies were smaller around\n",
      "than their heads, and dwindled away in a long line until their tails\n",
      "were slim as a shoe-string. Dorothy thought, if it had taken them\n",
      "sixty-six years to grow to this size, that it would be fully a hundred\n",
      "years more before they could hope to call themselves dragons, and that\n",
      "seemed like a good while to wait to grow up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It occurs to me,\" said the Wizard, \"that we ought to get out of this\n",
      "place before the mother dragon comes back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't hurry,\" called one of the dragonettes; \"mother will be glad to\n",
      "meet you, I'm sure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may be right,\" replied the Wizard, \"but we're a little particular\n",
      "about associating with strangers. Will you kindly tell us which way your\n",
      "mother went to get on top the earth?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is not a fair question to ask us,\" declared another dragonette.\n",
      "\"For, if we told you truly, you might escape us altogether; and if we\n",
      "told you an untruth we would be naughty and deserve to be punished.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then,\" decided Dorothy, \"we must find our way out the best we can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They circled all around the cavern, keeping a good distance away from\n",
      "the blinking yellow eyes of the dragonettes, and presently discovered\n",
      "that there were two paths leading from the wall opposite to the place\n",
      "where they had entered. They selected one of these at a venture and\n",
      "hurried along it as fast as they could go, for they had no idea when the\n",
      "mother dragon would be back and were very anxious not to make her\n",
      "acquaintance.\n",

      "hopeful and eager, thinking they might see sunshine at any minute. But\n",
      "at length they came unexpectedly upon a huge rock that shut off the\n",
      "passage and blocked them from proceeding a single step farther.\n",
      "\n",
      "This rock was separate from the rest of the mountain and was in motion,\n",
      "turning slowly around and around as if upon a pivot. When first they\n",
      "came to it there was a solid wall before them; but presently it revolved\n",
      "until there was exposed a wide, smooth path across it to the other side.\n",
      "This appeared so unexpectedly that they were unprepared to take\n",
      "advantage of it at first, and allowed the rocky wall to swing around\n",
      "again before they had decided to pass over. But they knew now that there\n",
      "was a means of escape and so waited patiently until the path appeared\n",
      "for the second time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The children and the Wizard rushed across the moving rock and sprang\n",
      "into the passage beyond, landing safely though a little out of breath.\n",
      "Jim the cab-horse came last, and the rocky wall almost caught him; for\n",
      "just as he leaped to the floor of the further passage the wall swung\n",
      "across it and a loose stone that the buggy wheels knocked against fell\n",
      "into the narrow crack where the rock turned, and became wedged there.\n",
      "\n",
      "They heard a crunching, grinding sound, a loud snap, and the turn-table\n",
      "came to a stop with its broadest surface shutting off the path from\n",
      "which they had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind,\" said Zeb, \"we don't want to get back, anyhow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not so sure of that,\" returned Dorothy. \"The mother dragon may come\n",
      "down and catch us here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is possible,\" agreed the Wizard, \"if this proves to be the path she\n",
      "usually takes. But I have been examining this tunnel, and I do not see\n",
      "any signs of so large a beast having passed through it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then we're all right,\" said the girl, \"for if the dragon went the other\n",
      "way she can't poss'bly get to us now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course not, my dear. But there is another thing to consider. The\n",
      "mother dragon probably knows the road to the earth's surface, and if she\n",
      "went the other way then we have come the wrong way,\" said the Wizard,\n",
      "thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear me!\" cried Dorothy. \"That would be unlucky, wouldn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very. Unless this passage also leads to the top of the earth,\" said\n",
      "Zeb. \"For my part, if we manage to get out of here I'll be glad it isn't\n",
      "the way the dragon goes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So will I,\" returned Dorothy. \"It's enough to have your pedigree flung\n",
      "in your face by those saucy dragonettes. No one knows what the mother\n",
      "might do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They now moved on again, creeping slowly up another steep incline. The\n",
      "lanterns were beginning to grow dim, and the Wizard poured the remaining\n",
      "oil from one into the other, so that the one light would last longer.\n",
      "But their journey was almost over, for in a short time they reached a\n",
      "small cave from which there was no further outlet.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not realize their ill fortune at first, for their hearts were\n",
      "gladdened by the sight of a ray of sunshine coming through a small crack\n",
      "in the roof of the cave, far overhead. That meant that their world--the\n",
      "real world--was not very far away, and that the succession of perilous\n",
      "adventures they had encountered had at last brought them near the\n",
      "earth's surface, which meant home to them. But when the adventurers\n",
      "looked more carefully around them they discovered that they were in a\n",
      "strong prison from which there was no hope of escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But we're _almost_ on earth again,\" cried Dorothy, \"for there is the\n",
      "sun--the most _beau'ful_ sun that shines!\" and she pointed eagerly at\n",
      "the crack in the distant roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Almost on earth isn't being there,\" said the kitten, in a discontented\n",
      "tone. \"It wouldn't be possible for even me to get up to that crack--or\n",
      "through it if I got there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It appears that the path ends here,\" announced the Wizard, gloomily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And there is no way to go back,\" added Zeb, with a low whistle of\n",
      "perplexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was sure it would come to this, in the end,\" remarked the old\n",
      "cab-horse. \"Folks don't fall into the middle of the earth and then get\n",
      "back again to tell of their adventures--not in real life. And the whole\n",
      "thing has been unnatural because that cat and I are both able to talk\n",
      "your language, and to understand the words you say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so can the nine tiny piglets,\" added Eureka. \"Don't forget them,\n",
      "for I may have to eat them, after all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've heard animals talk before,\" said Dorothy, \"and no harm came of\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Were you ever before shut up in a cave, far under the earth, with no\n",
      "way of getting out?\" enquired the horse, seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" answered Dorothy. \"But don't you lose heart, Jim, for I'm sure\n",
      "this isn't the end of our story, by any means.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The reference to the piglets reminded the Wizard that his pets had not\n",
      "enjoyed much exercise lately, and must be tired of their prison in his\n",
      "pocket. So he sat down upon the floor of the cave, brought the piglets\n",
      "out one by one, and allowed them to run around as much as they pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dears,\" he said to them, \"I'm afraid I've got you into a lot of\n",
      "trouble, and that you will never again be able to leave this gloomy\n",
      "cave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's wrong?\" asked a piglet. \"We've been in the dark quite a while,\n",
      "and you may as well explain what has happened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wizard told them of the misfortune that had overtaken the wanderers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said another piglet, \"you are a wizard, are you not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am,\" replied the little man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you can do a few wizzes and get us out of this hole,\" declared the\n",
      "tiny one, with much confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could if I happened to be a real wizard,\" returned the master sadly.\n",
      "\"But I'm not, my piggy-wees; I'm a humbug wizard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense!\" cried several of the piglets, together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can ask Dorothy,\" said the little man, in an injured tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's true enough,\" returned the girl, earnestly. \"Our friend Oz is\n",
      "merely a humbug wizard, for he once proved it to me. He can do several\n",
      "very wonderful things--if he knows how. But he can't wiz a single thing\n",
      "if he hasn't the tools and machinery to work with.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, my dear, for doing me justice,\" responded the Wizard,\n",
      "gratefully. \"To be accused of being a real wizard, when I'm not, is a\n",
      "slander I will not tamely submit to. But I am one of the greatest humbug\n",
      "wizards that ever lived, and you will realize this when we have all\n",
      "starved together and our bones are scattered over the floor of this\n",
      "lonely cave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe we'll realize anything, when it comes to that,\"\n",
      "remarked Dorothy, who had been deep in thought. \"But I'm not going to\n",
      "scatter my bones just yet, because I need them, and you prob'ly need\n",
      "yours, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are helpless to escape,\" sighed the Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_We_ may be helpless,\" answered Dorothy, smiling at him, \"but there are\n",
      "others who can do more than we can. Cheer up, friends. I'm sure Ozma\n",
      "will help us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ozma!\" exclaimed the Wizard. \"Who is Ozma?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The girl that rules the marvelous Land of Oz,\" was the reply. \"She's a\n",
      "friend of mine, for I met her in the Land of Ev, not long ago, and went\n",
      "to Oz with her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For the second time?\" asked the Wizard, with great interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. The first time I went to Oz I found you there, ruling the Emerald\n",
      "City. After you went up in a balloon, and escaped us, I got back to\n",
      "Kansas by means of a pair of magical silver shoes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I remember those shoes,\" said the little man, nodding. \"They once\n",
      "belonged to the Wicked Witch. Have you them here with you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; I lost them somewhere in the air,\" explained the child. \"But the\n",
      "second time I went to the Land of Oz I owned the Nome King's Magic Belt,\n",
      "which is much more powerful than were the Silver Shoes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is that Magic Belt?\" enquired the Wizard, who had listened with\n",
      "great interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ozma has it; for its powers won't work in a common, ordinary country\n",
      "like the United States. Anyone in a fairy country like the Land of Oz\n",
      "can do anything with it; so I left it with my friend the Princess Ozma,\n",
      "who used it to wish me in Australia with Uncle Henry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And were you?\" asked Zeb, astonished at what he heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course; in just a jiffy. And Ozma has an enchanted picture hanging\n",
      "in her room that shows her the exact scene where any of her friends may\n",
      "be, at any time she chooses. All she has to do is to say: 'I wonder what\n",
      "So-and-so is doing,' and at once the picture shows where her friend is\n",
      "and what the friend is doing. That's _real_ magic, Mr. Wizard; isn't it?\n",
      "Well, every day at four o'clock Ozma has promised to look at me in that\n",
      "picture, and if I am in need of help I am to make her a certain sign and\n",
      "she will put on the Nome King's Magic Belt and wish me to be with her in\n",
      "Oz.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean that Princess Ozma will see this cave in her enchanted\n",
      "picture, and see all of us here, and what we are doing?\" demanded Zeb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course; when it is four o'clock,\" she replied, with a laugh at his\n",
      "startled expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And when you make a sign she will bring you to her in the Land of Oz?\"\n",
      "continued the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's it, exactly; by means of the Magic Belt.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then,\" said the Wizard, \"you will be saved, little Dorothy; and I am\n",
      "very glad of it. The rest of us will die much more cheerfully when we\n",
      "know you have escaped our sad fate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_I_ won't die cheerfully!\" protested the kitten. \"There's nothing\n",
      "cheerful about dying that I could ever see, although they say a cat has\n",
      "nine lives, and so must die nine times.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you ever died yet?\" enquired the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, and I'm not anxious to begin,\" said Eureka.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't worry, dear,\" Dorothy exclaimed, \"I'll hold you in my arms, and\n",
      "take you with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take us, too!\" cried the nine tiny piglets, all in one breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps I can,\" answered Dorothy. \"I'll try.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Couldn't you manage to hold me in your arms?\" asked the cab-horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorothy laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll do better than that,\" she promised, \"for I can easily save you\n",
      "all, once I am myself in the Land of Oz.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How?\" they asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By using the Magic Belt. All I need do is to wish you with me, and\n",
      "there you'll be--safe in the royal palace!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good!\" cried Zeb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I built that palace, and the Emerald City, too,\" remarked the Wizard,\n",
      "in a thoughtful tone, \"and I'd like to see them again, for I was very\n",
      "happy among the Munchkins and Winkies and Quadlings and Gillikins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who are they?\" asked the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The four nations that inhabit the Land of Oz,\" was the reply. \"I wonder\n",
      "if they would treat me nicely if I went there again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course they would!\" declared Dorothy. \"They are still proud of their\n",
      "former Wizard, and often speak of you kindly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you happen to know whatever became of the Tin Woodman and the\n",
      "Scarecrow?\" he enquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They live in Oz yet,\" said the girl, \"and are very important people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the Cowardly Lion?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, he lives there too, with his friend the Hungry Tiger; and Billina\n",
      "is there, because she liked the place better than Kansas, and wouldn't\n",
      "go with me to Australia.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid I don't know the Hungry Tiger and Billina,\" said the Wizard,\n",
      "shaking his head. \"Is Billina a girl?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; she's a yellow hen, and a great friend of mine. You're sure to like\n",
      "Billina, when you know her,\" asserted Dorothy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your friends sound like a menagerie,\" remarked Zeb, uneasily.\n",
      "\"Couldn't you wish me in some safer place than Oz.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't worry,\" replied the girl. \"You'll just love the folks in Oz, when\n",
      "you get acquainted. What time is it, Mr. Wizard?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The little man looked at his watch--a big silver one that he carried in\n",
      "his vest pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Half-past three,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then we must wait for half an hour,\" she continued; \"but it won't take\n",
      "long, after that, to carry us all to the Emerald City.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They sat silently thinking for a time. Then Jim suddenly asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are there any horses in Oz?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only one,\" replied Dorothy, \"and he's a sawhorse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A what?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A sawhorse. Princess Ozma once brought him to life with a witch-powder,\n",
      "when she was a boy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Was Ozma once a boy?\" asked Zeb, wonderingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; a wicked witch enchanted her, so she could not rule her kingdom.\n",
      "But she's a girl now, and the sweetest, loveliest girl in all the\n",
      "world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A sawhorse is a thing they saw boards on,\" remarked Jim, with a sniff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is when it's not alive,\" acknowledged the girl. \"But this sawhorse\n",
      "can trot as fast as you can, Jim; and he's very wise, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pah! I'll race the miserable wooden donkey any day in the week!\" cried\n",
      "the cab-horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorothy did not reply to that. She felt that Jim would know more about\n",
      "the Saw-Horse later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time dragged wearily enough to the eager watchers, but finally the\n",
      "Wizard announced that four o'clock had arrived, and Dorothy caught up\n",
      "the kitten and began to make the signal that had been agreed upon to the\n",
      "far-away, invisible Ozma.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing seems to happen,\" said Zeb, doubtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, we must give Ozma time to put on the Magic Belt,\" replied the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had scarcely spoken the words when she suddenly disappeared from the\n",
      "cave, and with her went the kitten. There had been no sound of any kind\n",
      "and no warning. One moment Dorothy sat beside them with the kitten in\n",
      "her lap, and a moment later the horse, the piglets, the Wizard and the\n",
      "boy were all that remained in the underground prison.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why not, Mr. Wizard?\" asked Jellia, bowing low. \"But I'm afraid you\n",

      "beautiful Princess whom everyone loves dearly.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "The Wizard turned to look at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you not wear green whiskers at one time?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the soldier; \"but I shaved them off long ago, and since then\n",
      "I have risen from a private to be the Chief General of the Royal\n",
      "Armies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's nice,\" said the little man. \"But I assure you, my good people,\n",
      "that I do not wish to rule the Emerald City,\" he added, earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In that case you are very welcome!\" cried all the servants, and it\n",
      "pleased the Wizard to note the respect with which the royal retainers\n",
      "bowed before him. His fame had not been forgotten in the Land of Oz, by\n",
      "any means.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is Dorothy?\" enquired Zeb, anxiously, as he left the buggy and\n",
      "stood beside his friend the little Wizard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is with the Princess Ozma, in the private rooms of the palace,\"\n",
      "replied Jellia Jamb. \"But she has ordered me to make you welcome and to\n",
      "show you to your apartments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy looked around him with wondering eyes. Such magnificence and\n",
      "wealth as was displayed in this palace was more than he had ever dreamed\n",
      "of, and he could scarcely believe that all the gorgeous glitter was real\n",
      "and not tinsel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's to become of me?\" asked the horse, uneasily. He had seen\n",
      "considerable of life in the cities in his younger days, and knew that\n",
      "this regal palace was no place for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It perplexed even Jellia Jamb, for a time, to know what to do with the\n",
      "animal. The green maiden was much astonished at the sight of so unusual\n",
      "a creature, for horses were unknown in this Land; but those who lived in\n",
      "the Emerald City were apt to be astonished by queer sights, so after\n",
      "inspecting the cab-horse and noting the mild look in his big eyes the\n",
      "girl decided not to be afraid of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are no stables here,\" said the Wizard, \"unless some have been\n",
      "built since I went away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have never needed them before,\" answered Jellia; \"for the Sawhorse\n",
      "lives in a room of the palace, being much smaller and more natural in\n",
      "appearance than this great beast you have brought with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean that I'm a freak?\" asked Jim, angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" she hastened to say, \"there may be many more like you in the\n",
      "place you came from, but in Oz any horse but a Sawhorse is unusual.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This mollified Jim a little, and after some thought the green maiden\n",
      "decided to give the cab-horse a room in the palace, such a big building\n",
      "having many rooms that were seldom in use.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Zeb unharnessed Jim, and several of the servants then led the horse\n",
      "around to the rear, where they selected a nice large apartment that he\n",
      "could have all to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Jellia said to the Wizard:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your own room--which was back of the great Throne Room--has been vacant\n",
      "ever since you left us. Would you like it again?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed!\" returned the little man. \"It will seem like being at home\n",
      "again, for I lived in that room for many, many years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew the way to it, and a servant followed him, carrying his satchel.\n",
      "Zeb was also escorted to a room--so grand and beautiful that he almost\n",
      "feared to sit in the chairs or lie upon the bed, lest he might dim their\n",
      "splendor. In the closets he discovered many fancy costumes of rich\n",
      "velvets and brocades, and one of the attendants told him to dress\n",
      "himself in any of the clothes that pleased him and to be prepared to\n",
      "dine with the Princess and Dorothy in an hour's time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opening from the chamber was a fine bath-room having a marble tub with\n",
      "perfumed water; so the boy, still dazed by the novelty of his\n",
      "surroundings, indulged in a good bath and then selected a maroon velvet\n",
      "costume with silver buttons to replace his own soiled and much worn\n",
      "clothing. There were silk stockings and soft leather slippers with\n",
      "diamond buckles to accompany his new costume, and when he was fully\n",
      "dressed Zeb looked much more dignified and imposing than ever before in\n",
      "his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was all ready when an attendant came to escort him to the presence of\n",
      "the Princess; he followed bashfully and was ushered into a room more\n",
      "dainty and attractive than it was splendid. Here he found Dorothy seated\n",
      "beside a young girl so marvelously beautiful that the boy stopped\n",
      "suddenly with a gasp of admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Dorothy sprang up and ran to seize her friend's hand, drawing him\n",
      "impulsively toward the lovely Princess, who smiled most graciously upon\n",
      "her guest. Then the Wizard entered, and his presence relieved the boy's\n",
      "embarrassment. The little man was clothed in black velvet, with many\n",
      "sparkling emerald ornaments decorating his breast; but his bald head and\n",
      "wrinkled features made him appear more amusing than impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ozma had been quite curious to meet the famous man who had built the\n",
      "Emerald City and united the Munchkins, Gillikins, Quadlings and Winkies\n",
      "into one people; so when they were all four seated at the dinner table\n",
      "the Princess said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please tell me, Mr. Wizard, whether you called yourself Oz after this\n",
      "great country, or whether you believe my country is called Oz after you.\n",
      "It is a matter that I have long wished to enquire about, because you are\n",
      "of a strange race and my own name is Ozma. No one, I am sure, is better\n",
      "able to explain this mystery than you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is true,\" answered the little Wizard; \"therefore it will give me\n",
      "pleasure to explain my connection with your country. In the first place,\n",
      "I must tell you that I was born in Omaha, and my father, who was a\n",
      "politician, named me Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkle\n",
      "Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs, Diggs being the last name because he could\n",
      "think of no more to go before it. Taken altogether, it was a dreadfully\n",
      "long name to weigh down a poor innocent child, and one of the hardest\n",
      "lessons I ever learned was to remember my own name. When I grew up I\n",
      "just called myself O. Z., because the other initials were P-I-N-H-E-A-D;\n",
      "and that spelled 'pinhead,' which was a reflection on my intelligence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely no one could blame you for cutting your name short,\" said Ozma,\n",
      "sympathetically. \"But didn't you cut it almost too short?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps so,\" replied the Wizard. \"When a young man I ran away from home\n",
      "and joined a circus. I used to call myself a Wizard, and do tricks of\n",
      "ventriloquism.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What does that mean?\" asked the Princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Throwing my voice into any object I pleased, to make it appear that the\n",
      "object was speaking instead of me. Also I began to make balloon\n",
      "ascensions. On my balloon and on all the other articles I used in the\n",
      "circus I painted the two initials: 'O. Z.', to show that those things\n",
      "belonged to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One day my balloon ran away with me and brought me across the deserts\n",
      "to this beautiful country. When the people saw me come from the sky they\n",
      "naturally thought me some superior creature, and bowed down before me. I\n",
      "told them I was a Wizard, and showed them some easy tricks that amazed\n",
      "them; and when they saw the initials painted on the balloon they called\n",
      "me Oz.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I begin to understand,\" said the Princess, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At that time,\" continued the Wizard, busily eating his soup while\n",
      "talking, \"there were four separate countries in this Land, each one of\n",
      "the four being ruled by a Witch. But the people thought my power was\n",
      "greater than that of the Witches; and perhaps the Witches thought so\n",
      "too, for they never dared oppose me. I ordered the Emerald City to be\n",
      "built just where the four countries cornered together, and when it was\n",
      "completed I announced myself the Ruler of the Land of Oz, which included\n",
      "all the four countries of the Munchkins, the Gillikins, the Winkies and\n",
      "the Quadlings. Over this Land I ruled in peace for many years, until I\n",
      "grew old and longed to see my native city once again. So when Dorothy\n",
      "was first blown to this place by a cyclone I arranged to go away with\n",
      "her in a balloon; but the balloon escaped too soon and carried me back\n",
      "alone. After many adventures I reached Omaha, only to find that all my\n",
      "old friends were dead or had moved away. So, having nothing else to do,\n",
      "I joined a circus again, and made my balloon ascensions until the\n",
      "earthquake caught me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is quite a history,\" said Ozma; \"but there is a little more\n",
      "history about the Land of Oz that you do not seem to understand--perhaps\n",
      "for the reason that no one ever told it you. Many years before you came\n",
      "here this Land was united under one Ruler, as it is now, and the Ruler's\n",
      "name was always 'Oz', which means in our language 'Great and Good'; or,\n",
      "if the Ruler happened to be a woman, her name was always 'Ozma.' But\n",
      "once upon a time four Witches leagued together to depose the king and\n",
      "rule the four parts of the kingdom themselves; so when the Ruler, my\n",
      "grandfather, was hunting one day, one Wicked Witch named Mombi stole him\n",
      "and carried him away, keeping him a close prisoner. Then the Witches\n",
      "divided up the kingdom, and ruled the four parts of it until you came\n",
      "here. That was why the people were so glad to see you, and why they\n",
      "thought from your initials that you were their rightful ruler.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, at that time,\" said the Wizard, thoughtfully, \"there were two Good\n",
      "Witches and two Wicked Witches ruling in the land.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" replied Ozma, \"because a good Witch had conquered Mombi in the\n",
      "North and Glinda the Good had conquered the evil Witch in the South. But\n",
      "Mombi was still my grandfather's jailor, and afterward my father's\n",
      "jailor. When I was born she transformed me into a boy, hoping that no\n",
      "one would ever recognize me and know that I was the rightful Princess of\n",
      "the Land of Oz. But I escaped from her and am now the Ruler of my\n",
      "people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very glad of that,\" said the Wizard, \"and hope you will consider\n",
      "me one of your most faithful and devoted subjects.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We owe a great deal to the Wonderful Wizard,\" continued the Princess,\n",
      "\"for it was you who built this splendid Emerald City.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your people built it,\" he answered. \"I only bossed the job, as we say\n",
      "in Omaha.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you ruled it wisely and well for many years,\" said she, \"and made\n",
      "the people proud of your magical art. So, as you are now too old to\n",
      "wander abroad and work in a circus, I offer you a home here as long as\n",
      "you live. You shall be the Official Wizard of my kingdom, and be treated\n",
      "with every respect and consideration.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I accept your kind offer with gratitude, gracious Princess,\" the little\n",
      "man said, in a soft voice, and they could all see that tear-drops were\n",
      "standing in his keen old eyes. It meant a good deal to him to secure a\n",
      "home like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's only a humbug Wizard, though,\" said Dorothy, smiling at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And that is the safest kind of a Wizard to have,\" replied Ozma,\n",
      "promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oz can do some good tricks, humbug or no humbug,\" announced Zeb, who\n",
      "was now feeling more at ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He shall amuse us with his tricks tomorrow,\" said the Princess. \"I have\n",
      "sent messengers to summon all of Dorothy's old friends to meet her and\n",
      "give her welcome, and they ought to arrive very soon, now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, the dinner was no sooner finished than in rushed the Scarecrow,\n",
      "to hug Dorothy in his padded arms and tell her how glad he was to see\n",
      "her again. The Wizard was also most heartily welcomed by the straw man,\n",
      "who was an important personage in the Land of Oz.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How are your brains?\" enquired the little humbug, as he grasped the\n",
      "soft, stuffed hands of his old friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Working finely,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"I'm very certain, Oz, that\n",
      "you gave me the best brains in the world, for I can think with them day\n",
      "and night, when all other brains are fast asleep.\"\n",

      "\"How long did you rule the Emerald City, after I left here?\" was the\n",
      "next question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite awhile, until I was conquered by a girl named General Jinjur. But\n",
      "Ozma soon conquered her, with the help of Glinda the Good, and after\n",
      "that I went to live with Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then a loud cackling was heard outside; and, when a servant threw\n",
      "open the door with a low bow, a yellow hen strutted in. Dorothy sprang\n",
      "forward and caught the fluffy fowl in her arms, uttering at the same\n",
      "time a glad cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Billina!\" she said; \"how fat and sleek you've grown.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why shouldn't I?\" asked the hen, in a sharp, clear voice. \"I live on\n",
      "the fat of the land--don't I, Ozma?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have everything you wish for,\" said the Princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around Billina's neck was a string of beautiful pearls, and on her legs\n",
      "were bracelets of emeralds. She nestled herself comfortably in Dorothy's\n",
      "lap until the kitten gave a snarl of jealous anger and leaped up with a\n",
      "sharp claw fiercely bared to strike Billina a blow. But the little girl\n",
      "gave the angry kitten such a severe cuff that it jumped down again\n",
      "without daring to scratch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How horrid of you, Eureka!\" cried Dorothy. \"Is that the way to treat my\n",
      "friends?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Look here!\" said Dorothy, sternly. \"I won't have any quarrelling in the\n",
      "Land of Oz, I can tell you! Everybody lives in peace here, and loves\n",
      "everybody else; and unless you two, Billina and Eureka, make up and be\n",
      "friends, I'll take my Magic Belt and wish you both home again,\n",
      "_immejitly_. So, there!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were both much frightened at the threat, and promised meekly to be\n",

      "And now the Tin Woodman arrived, his body most beautifully\n",
      "nickle-plated, so that it shone splendidly in the brilliant light of the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad to hear that,\" said the Wizard. \"I was afraid it would get\n",

      "as a mere detail, and at his command the attendants gave his coat a good\n",
      "rubbing, combed his mane and tail, and washed his hoofs and fetlocks.\n",
      "Then they told him dinner would be served directly and he replied that\n",
      "they could not serve it too quickly to suit his convenience. First they\n",
      "brought him a steaming bowl of soup, which the horse eyed in dismay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take that stuff away!\" he commanded. \"Do you take me for a\n",
      "salamander?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They obeyed at once, and next served a fine large turbot on a silver\n",
      "platter, with drawn gravey poured over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fish!\" cried Jim, with a sniff. \"Do you take me for a tom-cat? Away\n",
      "with it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The servants were a little discouraged, but soon they brought in a great\n",
      "tray containing two dozen nicely roasted quail on toast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, well!\" said the horse, now thoroughly provoked. \"Do you take me\n",
      "for a weasel? How stupid and ignorant you are, in the Land of Oz, and\n",
      "what dreadful things you feed upon! Is there nothing that is decent to\n",
      "eat in this palace?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The trembling servants sent for the Royal Steward, who came in haste and\n",
      "said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What would your Highness like for dinner?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Highness!\" repeated Jim, who was unused to such titles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are at least six feet high, and that is higher than any other\n",
      "animal in this country,\" said the Steward.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, my Highness would like some oats,\" declared the horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oats? We have no whole oats,\" the Steward replied, with much\n",
      "defference. \"But there is any quantity of oatmeal, which we often cook\n",
      "for breakfast. Oatmeal is a breakfast dish,\" added the Steward, humbly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll make it a dinner dish,\" said Jim. \"Fetch it on, but don't cook it,\n",
      "as you value your life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You see, the respect shown the worn-out old cab-horse made him a little\n",
      "arrogant, and he forgot he was a guest, never having been treated\n",
      "otherwise than as a servant since the day he was born, until his arrival\n",
      "in the Land of Oz. But the royal attendants did not heed the animal's\n",
      "ill temper. They soon mixed a tub of oatmeal with a little water, and\n",
      "Jim ate it with much relish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the servants heaped a lot of rugs upon the floor and the old horse\n",
      "slept on the softest bed he had ever known in his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning, as soon as it was daylight, he resolved to take a walk\n",
      "and try to find some grass for breakfast; so he ambled calmly through\n",
      "the handsome arch of the doorway, turned the corner of the palace,\n",
      "wherein all seemed asleep, and came face to face with the Sawhorse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim stopped abruptly, being startled and amazed. The Sawhorse stopped at\n",
      "the same time and stared at the other with its queer protruding eyes,\n",
      "which were mere knots in the log that formed its body. The legs of the\n",
      "Sawhorse were four sticks driven into holes bored in the log; its tail\n",
      "was a small branch that had been left by accident and its mouth a place\n",
      "chopped in one end of the body which projected a little and served as\n",
      "a head. The ends of the wooden legs were shod with plates of solid gold,\n",
      "and the saddle of the Princess Ozma, which was of red leather set with\n",
      "sparkling diamonds, was strapped to the clumsy body.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: \"FOR GOODNESS SAKE, WHAT SORT OF A BEING ARE YOU?\"]\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim's eyes stuck out as much as those of the Sawhorse, and he stared at\n",
      "the creature with his ears erect and his long head drawn back until it\n",
      "rested against his arched neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this comical position the two horses circled slowly around each other\n",
      "for a while, each being unable to realize what the singular thing might\n",
      "be which it now beheld for the first time. Then Jim exclaimed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For goodness sake, what sort of a being are you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm a Sawhorse,\" replied the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh; I believe I've heard of you,\" said the cab-horse; \"but you are\n",
      "unlike anything that I expected to see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not doubt it,\" the Sawhorse observed, with a tone of pride. \"I am\n",
      "considered quite unusual.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are, indeed. But a rickety wooden thing like you has no right to be\n",
      "alive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I couldn't help it,\" returned the other, rather crestfallen. \"Ozma\n",
      "sprinkled me with a magic powder, and I just had to live. I know I'm not\n",
      "much account; but I'm the only horse in all the Land of Oz, so they\n",
      "treat me with great respect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You, a horse!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, not a real one, of course. There are no real horses here at all.\n",
      "But I'm a splendid imitation of one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim gave an indignant neigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look at me!\" he cried. \"Behold a real horse!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The wooden animal gave a start, and then examined the other intently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it possible that you are a Real Horse?\" he murmured.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not only possible, but true,\" replied Jim, who was gratified by the\n",
      "impression he had created. \"It is proved by my fine points. For example,\n",
      "look at the long hairs on my tail, with which I can whisk away the\n",
      "flies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The flies never trouble me,\" said the Saw-Horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And notice my great strong teeth, with which I nibble the grass.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not necessary for me to eat,\" observed the Saw-horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Also examine my broad chest, which enables me to draw deep, full\n",
      "breaths,\" said Jim, proudly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have no need to breathe,\" returned the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; you miss many pleasures,\" remarked the cab-horse, pityingly. \"You\n",
      "do not know the relief of brushing away a fly that has bitten you, nor\n",
      "the delight of eating delicious food, nor the satisfaction of drawing a\n",
      "long breath of fresh, pure air. You may be an imitation of a horse, but\n",
      "you're a mighty poor one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I cannot hope ever to be like you,\" sighed the Sawhorse. \"But I am\n",
      "glad to meet at last a Real Horse. You are certainly the most beautiful\n",
      "creature I ever beheld.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This praise won Jim completely. To be called beautiful was a novelty in\n",
      "his experience. Said he:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your chief fault, my friend, is in being made of wood, and that I\n",
      "suppose you cannot help. Real horses, like myself, are made of flesh and\n",
      "blood and bones.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can see the bones all right,\" replied the Sawhorse, \"and they are\n",
      "admirable and distinct. Also I can see the flesh. But the blood, I\n",
      "suppose, is tucked away inside.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Jim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What good is it?\" asked the Sawhorse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim did not know, but he would not tell the Sawhorse that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If anything cuts me,\" he replied, \"the blood runs out to show where I\n",
      "am cut. You, poor thing! cannot even bleed when you are hurt.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I am never hurt,\" said the Sawhorse. \"Once in a while I get broken\n",
      "up some, but I am easily repaired and put in good order again. And I\n",
      "never feel a break or a splinter in the least.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim was almost tempted to envy the wooden horse for being unable to feel\n",
      "pain; but the creature was so absurdly unnatural that he decided he\n",
      "would not change places with it under any circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you happen to be shod with gold?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Princess Ozma did that,\" was the reply; \"and it saves my legs from\n",
      "wearing out. We've had a good many adventures together, Ozma and I, and\n",
      "she likes me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The cab-horse was about to reply when suddenly he gave a start and a\n",
      "neigh of terror and stood trembling like a leaf. For around the corner\n",
      "had come two enormous savage beasts, treading so lightly that they were\n",
      "upon him before he was aware of their presence. Jim was in the act of\n",
      "plunging down the path to escape when the Sawhorse cried out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop, my brother! Stop, Real Horse! These are friends, and will do you\n",
      "no harm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim hesitated, eyeing the beasts fearfully. One was an enormous Lion\n",
      "with clear, intelligent eyes, a tawney mane bushy and well kept, and a\n",
      "body like yellow plush. The other was a great Tiger with purple stripes\n",
      "around his lithe body, powerful limbs, and eyes that showed through the\n",
      "half closed lids like coals of fire. The huge forms of these monarchs of\n",
      "the forest and jungle were enough to strike terror to the stoutest\n",
      "heart, and it is no wonder Jim was afraid to face them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Sawhorse introduced the stranger in a calm tone, saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This, noble Horse, is my friend the Cowardly Lion, who is the valiant\n",
      "King of the Forest, but at the same time a faithful vassal of Princess\n",
      "Ozma. And this is the Hungry Tiger, the terror of the jungle, who longs\n",
      "to devour fat babies but is prevented by his conscience from doing so.\n",
      "These royal beasts are both warm friends of little Dorothy and have come\n",
      "to the Emerald City this morning to welcome her to our fairyland.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing these words Jim resolved to conquer his alarm. He bowed his head\n",
      "with as much dignity as he could muster toward the savage looking\n",
      "beasts, who in return nodded in a friendly way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is not the Real Horse a beautiful animal?\" asked the Sawhorse\n",
      "admiringly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is doubtless a matter of taste,\" returned the Lion. \"In the forest\n",
      "he would be thought ungainly, because his face is stretched out and his\n",
      "neck is uselessly long. His joints, I notice, are swollen and overgrown,\n",
      "and he lacks flesh and is old in years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And dreadfully tough,\" added the Hungry Tiger, in a sad voice. \"My\n",
      "conscience would never permit me to eat so tough a morsel as the Real\n",
      "Horse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad of that,\" said Jim; \"for I, also, have a conscience, and it\n",
      "tells me not to crush in your skull with a blow of my powerful hoof.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If he thought to frighten the striped beast by such language he was\n",
      "mistaken. The Tiger seemed to smile, and winked one eye slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have a good conscience, friend Horse,\" it said, \"and if you attend\n",
      "to its teachings it will do much to protect you from harm. Some day I\n",
      "will let you try to crush in my skull, and afterward you will know more\n",
      "about tigers than you do now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any friend of Dorothy,\" remarked the Cowardly Lion, \"must be our\n",
      "friend, as well. So let us cease this talk of skull crushing and\n",
      "converse upon more pleasant subjects. Have you breakfasted, Sir Horse?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not yet,\" replied Jim. \"But here is plenty of excellent clover, so if\n",
      "you will excuse me I will eat now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's a vegetarian,\" remarked the Tiger, as the horse began to munch the\n",
      "clover. \"If I could eat grass I would not need a conscience, for nothing\n",
      "could then tempt me to devour babies and lambs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then Dorothy, who had risen early and heard the voices of the\n",
      "animals, ran out to greet her old friends. She hugged both the Lion and\n",
      "the Tiger with eager delight, but seemed to love the King of Beasts a\n",
      "little better than she did his hungry friend, having known him longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time they had indulged in a good talk and Dorothy had told them\n",
      "all about the awful earthquake and her recent adventures, the breakfast\n",
      "bell rang from the palace and the little girl went inside to join her\n",
      "human comrades. As she entered the great hall a voice called out, in a\n",
      "rather harsh tone:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What! are _you_ here again?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I am,\" she answered, looking all around to see where the voice\n",
      "came from.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What brought you back?\" was the next question, and Dorothy's eye rested\n",
      "on an antlered head hanging on the wall just over the fireplace, and\n",
      "caught its lips in the act of moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good gracious!\" she exclaimed. \"I thought you were stuffed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I am,\" replied the head. \"But once on a time I was part of the Gump,\n",
      "which Ozma sprinkled with the Powder of Life. I was then for a time the\n",
      "Head of the finest Flying Machine that was ever known to exist, and we\n",
      "did many wonderful things. Afterward the Gump was taken apart and I was\n",
      "put back on this wall; but I can still talk when I feel in the mood,\n",
      "which is not often.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's very strange,\" said the girl. \"What were you when you were first\n",
      "alive?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That I have forgotten,\" replied the Gump's Head, \"and I do not think it\n",
      "is of much importance. But here comes Ozma; so I'd better hush up, for\n",
      "the Princess doesn't like me to chatter since she changed her name from\n",
      "Tip to Ozma.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then the girlish Ruler of Oz opened the door and greeted Dorothy\n",
      "with a good-morning kiss. The little Princess seemed fresh and rosy and\n",
      "in good spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Breakfast is served, dear,\" she said, \"and I am hungry. So don't let us\n",
      "keep it waiting a single minute.\"\n",

      "After breakfast Ozma announced that she had ordered a holiday to be\n",
      "observed throughout the Emerald City, in honor of her visitors. The\n",
      "people had learned that their old Wizard had returned to them and all\n",
      "were anxious to see him again, for he had always been a rare favorite.\n",
      "So first there was to be a grand procession through the streets, after\n",
      "which the little old man was requested to perform some of his wizardries\n",
      "in the great Throne Room of the palace. In the afternoon there were to\n",
      "be games and races.\n",
      "\n",
      "The procession was very imposing. First came the Imperial Cornet Band of\n",
      "Oz, dressed in emerald velvet uniforms with slashes of pea-green satin\n",
      "and buttons of immense cut emeralds. They played the National air\n",
      "called \"The Oz Spangled Banner,\" and behind them were the standard\n",
      "bearers with the Royal flag. This flag was divided into four quarters,\n",
      "one being colored sky-blue, another pink, a third lavender and a fourth\n",
      "white. In the center was a large emerald-green star, and all over the\n",
      "four quarters were sewn spangles that glittered beautifully in the\n",
      "sunshine. The colors represented the four countries of Oz, and the green\n",
      "star the Emerald City.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just behind the royal standard-bearers came the Princess Ozma in her\n",
      "royal chariot, which was of gold encrusted with emeralds and diamonds\n",
      "set in exquisite designs. The chariot was drawn on this occasion by the\n",
      "Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger, who were decorated with immense pink\n",
      "and blue bows. In the chariot rode Ozma and Dorothy, the former in\n",
      "splendid raiment and wearing her royal coronet, while the little Kansas\n",
      "girl wore around her waist the Magic Belt she had once captured from the\n",
      "Nome King.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the chariot came the Scarecrow mounted on the Sawhorse, and\n",
      "the people cheered him almost as loudly as they did their lovely Ruler.\n",
      "Behind him stalked with regular, jerky steps, the famous machine-man\n",
      "called Tik-tok, who had been wound up by Dorothy for the occasion.\n",
      "Tik-tok moved by clockwork, and was made all of burnished copper. He\n",
      "really belonged to the Kansas girl, who had much respect for his\n",
      "thoughts after they had been properly wound and set going; but as the\n",
      "copper man would be useless in any place but a fairy country Dorothy had\n",
      "left him in charge of Ozma, who saw that he was suitably cared for.\n",
      "\n",
      "There followed another band after this, which was called the Royal Court\n",
      "Band, because the members all lived in the palace. They wore white\n",
      "uniforms with real diamond buttons and played \"What is Oz without Ozma\"\n",
      "very sweetly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came Professor Woggle-Bug, with a group of students from the Royal\n",
      "College of Scientific Athletics. The boys wore long hair and striped\n",
      "sweaters and yelled their college yell every other step they took, to\n",
      "the great satisfaction of the populace, which was glad to have this\n",
      "evidence that their lungs were in good condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brilliantly polished Tin Woodman marched next, at the head of the\n",
      "Royal Army of Oz which consisted of twenty-eight officers, from Generals\n",
      "down to Captains. There were no privates in the army because all were so\n",
      "courageous and skillful that they had been promoted one by one until\n",
      "there were no privates left. Jim and the buggy followed, the old\n",
      "cab-horse being driven by Zeb while the Wizard stood up on the seat and\n",
      "bowed his bald head right and left in answer to the cheers of the\n",
      "people, who crowded thick about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taken altogether the procession was a grand success, and when it had\n",
      "returned to the palace the citizens crowded into the great Throne Room\n",
      "to see the Wizard perform his tricks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing the little humbug did was to produce a tiny white piglet\n",
      "from underneath his hat and pretend to pull it apart, making two. This\n",
      "act he repeated until all of the nine tiny piglets were visible, and\n",
      "they were so glad to get out of his pocket that they ran around in a\n",
      "very lively manner. The pretty little creatures would have been a\n",
      "novelty anywhere, so the people were as amazed and delighted at their\n",
      "appearance as even the Wizard could have desired. When he had made them\n",
      "all disappear again Ozma declared she was sorry they were gone, for she\n",
      "wanted one of them to pet and play with. So the Wizard pretended to take\n",
      "one of the piglets out of the hair of the Princess (while really he\n",
      "slyly took it from his inside pocket) and Ozma smiled joyously as the\n",
      "creature nestled in her arms, and she promised to have an emerald collar\n",
      "made for its fat neck and to keep the little squealer always at hand to\n",
      "amuse her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterward it was noticed that the Wizard always performed his famous\n",
      "trick with eight piglets, but it seemed to please the people just as\n",
      "well as if there had been nine of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his little room back of the Throne Room the Wizard had found a lot of\n",
      "things he had left behind him when he went away in the balloon, for no\n",
      "one had occupied the apartment in his absence. There was enough material\n",
      "there to enable him to prepare several new tricks which he had learned\n",
      "from some of the jugglers in the circus, and he had passed part of the\n",
      "night in getting them ready. So he followed the trick of the nine tiny\n",
      "piglets with several other wonderful feats that greatly delighted his\n",
      "audience and the people did not seem to care a bit whether the little\n",
      "man was a humbug Wizard or not, so long as he succeeded in amusing them.\n",
      "They applauded all his tricks and at the end of the performance begged\n",
      "him earnestly not to go away again and leave them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In that case,\" said the little man, gravely, \"I will cancel all of my\n",

      "myself to the people of Oz, for I love you all so well that I can deny\n",
      "you nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After the people had been dismissed with this promise our friends joined\n",
      "Princess Ozma at an elaborate luncheon in the palace, where even the\n",

      "was twice as old as Zeb, for he had long pointed whiskers and wore a\n",
      "peaked hat with little bells all around the brim of it, which tinkled\n",
      "gaily as he moved. But although the Munchkin was hardly tall enough to\n",

      "that Zeb managed to give him a sharp box on the ears the Munchkin sat\n",
      "down upon the ground and cried until the tears ran down his whiskers,\n",
      "because he had been hurt. This made Zeb laugh, in turn, and the boy\n",

      "subject as she had at him.\n",

      "do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bah!\" cried Jim, looking with great disdain at the other; \"do you\n",
      "imagine for an instant that such a shabby imitation of a horse as you\n",
      "are can run as fast as I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know, I'm sure,\" replied the Sawhorse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is what we are trying to find out,\" remarked the Scarecrow. \"The\n",
      "object of a race is to see who can win it--or at least that is what my\n",
      "excellent brains think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Once, when I was young,\" said Jim, \"I was a race horse, and defeated\n",
      "all who dared run against me. I was born in Kentucky, you know, where\n",
      "all the best and most aristocratic horses come from.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you're old, now, Jim,\" suggested Zeb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Old! Why, I feel like a colt today,\" replied Jim. \"I only wish there\n",
      "was a real horse here for me to race with. I'd show the people a fine\n",
      "sight, I can tell you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then why not race with the Sawhorse?\" enquired the Scarecrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's afraid,\" said Jim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" answered the Sawhorse. \"I merely said it wasn't fair. But if\n",
      "my friend the Real Horse is willing to undertake the race I am quite\n",
      "ready.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So they unharnessed Jim and took the saddle off the Sawhorse, and the\n",
      "two queerly matched animals were stood side by side for the start.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I say 'Go!'\" Zeb called to them, \"you must dig out and race until\n",

      "\n",
      "\"If you have, it is invisible,\" said the Princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very true,\" returned the Woggle-Bug, bowing. \"I say I see the criminal,\n",
      "in my mind's eye, creeping stealthily into the room of our Ozma and\n",
      "secreting herself, when no one was looking, until the Princess had gone\n",
      "away and the door was closed. Then the murderer was alone with her\n",
      "helpless victim, the fat piglet, and I see her pounce upon the innocent\n",
      "creature and eat it up----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you still seeing with your mind's eye?\" enquired the Scarecrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course; how else could I see it? And we know the thing is true,\n",

      "\"Very likely,\" acknowledged the Woggle-Bug. \"And now, Fellow Citizens\n",
      "and Creatures of the Jury, I assert that so awful a crime deserves\n",

      "guilty, and surely it is unkind to accuse a luncheon of being a murder.\n",
      "Eureka is the sweet pet of a lovely little girl whom we all admire, and\n",
      "gentleness and innocence are her chief virtues. Look at the kitten's\n",
      "intelligent eyes;\" (here Eureka closed her eyes sleepily) \"gaze at her\n",
      "smiling countenance!\" (here Eureka snarled and showed her teeth) \"mark\n",
      "the tender pose of her soft, padded little hands!\" (Here Eureka bared\n",
      "her sharp claws and scratched at the bars of the cage.) \"Would such a\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Then say something sensible,\" retorted the kitten. \"Tell them it would\n",
      "be foolish for me to eat the piglet, because I had sense enough to know\n",
      "it would raise a row if I did. But don't try to make out I'm too\n",
      "innocent to eat a fat piglet if I could do it and not be found out. I\n",
      "imagine it would taste mighty good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps it would, to those who eat,\" remarked the Tin Woodman. \"I\n",
      "myself, not being built to eat, have no personal experience in such\n",

      "for a few minutes and then they appointed the Hungry Tiger their\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Kittens have no consciences, so they eat whatever pleases them. The\n",

      "death in punishment of the crime.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The judgment of the jury was received with great applause, although\n",
      "Dorothy was sobbing miserably at the fate of her pet. The Princess was\n",

      "when that brilliant personage once more arose and addressed her.\n",
      "\n",

      "The kitten could not have eaten your piglet--for here it is!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He took off his funnel hat and from beneath it produced a tiny white\n",
      "piglet, which he held aloft that all might see it clearly.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Give me my pet, Nick Chopper!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And all the people cheered and clapped their hands, rejoicing that the\n",

      "\n",
      "As the Princess held the white piglet in her arms and stroked its soft\n",

      "Chopper?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\"I refuse to be free,\" cried the kitten, in a sharp voice, \"unless the\n",

      "then this it not the piglet that was lost, but another one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hush, Eureka!\" warned the Wizard.\n",

      "of your pet piglet.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I will confess that I intended to eat the little pig for my breakfast;\n",
      "so I crept into the room where it was kept while the Princess was\n",
      "dressing and hid myself under a chair. When Ozma went away she closed\n",
      "the door and left her pet on the table. At once I jumped up and told the\n",
      "piglet not to make a fuss, for he would be inside of me in half a\n",
      "second; but no one can teach one of these creatures to be reasonable.\n",
      "Instead of keeping still, so I could eat him comfortably, he trembled so\n",
      "with fear that he fell off the table into a big vase that was standing\n",
      "on the floor. The vase had a very small neck, and spread out at the top\n",
      "like a bowl. At first the piglet stuck in the neck of the vase and I\n",
      "thought I should get him, after all, but he wriggled himself through and\n",
      "fell down into the deep bottom part--and I suppose he's there yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All were astonished at this confession, and Ozma at once sent an officer\n",
      "to her room to fetch the vase. When he returned the Princess looked down\n",
      "the narrow neck of the big ornament and discovered her lost piglet, just\n",
      "as Eureka had said she would.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no way to get the creature out without breaking the vase, so\n",
      "the Tin Woodman smashed it with his axe and set the little prisoner\n",
      "free.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the crowd cheered lustily and Dorothy hugged the kitten in her arms\n",

      "Ozma gave the Wizard back the piglet he had so kindly allowed Nick\n",
      "Chopper to substitute for the lost one, and then she carried her own\n",
      "into the apartments of the palace where she lived. And now, the trial\n",

      "knew the kitten had tried to commit the crime, and that only an accident\n",
      "had prevented her from doing so; therefore even the Hungry Tiger\n",
      "preferred not to associate with her. Eureka was forbidden to wander\n",
      "around the palace and was made to stay in confinement in Dorothy's room;\n",

      "                 Preceding _Memoirs_ of Mr. BRAINERD.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I. WE have here an opportunity, in a very lively _instance_, to see the\n",
      "_nature_ of _true religion_; and the _manner_ of its _operation_ when\n",
      "exemplified in a high degree. Particularly it may be observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. How greatly Mr. Brainerd’s religion differed from that of some who,\n",
      "depending on something past, settle in a cold, careless, and carnal\n",
      "frame of mind, and in a neglect of thorough, earnest religion. Although\n",
      "his convictions and conversion were exceeding clear, yet how far was\n",
      "he from acting as though he thought he had _got through his work_, when\n",
      "once he had obtained satisfaction of his interest in Christ? On the\n",
      "contrary, this was with him but the beginning of his work, his entering\n",
      "on the great business, his first setting out in his race. His obtaining\n",
      "rest in Christ, after earnest striving to enter in at the strait\n",
      "gate, he did not look upon as putting an end to any further occasion\n",
      "for striving and violence in religion: but these were continued, and\n",
      "maintained constantly, through all changes, to the very end of life.\n",
      "He continued pressing forward, forgeting the things that were behind,\n",
      "and reaching forth towards the things that were before. His pains and\n",
      "earnestness in religion were rather increased than diminished, after he\n",
      "had received satisfaction concerning the safety of his state. Love to\n",
      "God, and longings after holiness, were more effectual to engage him to\n",
      "pains and activity, than fear of hell had been before.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as his conversion was not the end of his work, or of his diligence\n",
      "in religion; so neither was it the end of the _work of the Spirit_ of\n",
      "God on his heart; but rather the beginning; the first dawning of the\n",
      "light, which thenceforward increased more and more; the beginning of\n",
      "his holy affections, his sorrow for sin, his love to God, his rejoicing\n",
      "in Christ, his longings after holiness. And the powerful operations\n",
      "of the Spirit of God herein, were carried on, from the day of his\n",
      "conversion, to his dying day. His religious experiences, his admiration,\n",
      "joy, and praise, did not only hold for a few days, weeks, or months;\n",
      "and then gradually die away, till they came to leave him without any\n",
      "sensible experience of holy and divine affections, for months together;\n",
      "as it is with many, who soon come to that pass, that it is again with\n",
      "them much as it is used to be before their conversion, with respect to\n",
      "any present views of God’s glory, or ardent out-goings of their souls\n",
      "after divine objects; but only now and then they have a comfortable\n",
      "reflection on times past; and so rest easy, thinking all well; they\n",
      "have had a good clear work, and they doubt not but they shall go to\n",
      "heaven when they die. How far otherwise was it with Mr. Brainerd! His\n",
      "experiences, instead of dying away, were evidently of an increasing\n",
      "nature. His first love, and other holy affections, even at the\n",
      "beginning were very great; but after months and years, became\n",
      "much greater, and more remarkable; and the exercises of his mind\n",
      "continued exceeding great, (though not equally so at all times) without\n",
      "remissness, and without dwindling away, even till his decease. They\n",
      "began in a time of general deadness, and were greatly increased in the\n",
      "general reviving of religion. And when a general deadness returned,\n",
      "his experiences were still kept up in their height, and so continued\n",
      "in a general course wherever he was, in sickness and in health, living\n",
      "and dying. The change that was wrought in him at his conversion,\n",
      "was agreeable to scripture, a great change, and an abiding change,\n",
      "rendering him a new creature: not only a change as to comfort; and a\n",
      "transient change, consisting in passing affections; but a change of\n",
      "_nature_, a change of the abiding temper of his mind. Not a partial\n",
      "change, in opinion, or outward reformation, much less a change from one\n",
      "error to another; but an universal change, both internal, and external,\n",
      "from the habits of sin, to universal holiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "*It appears plainly, from his conversion to his death, that the great\n",
      "object of the new appetites given him, and thenceforward maintained and\n",
      "increased in his heart, was HOLINESS, conformity to God, living to God,\n",
      "and glorifying him. This was what drew his heart; this was the center\n",
      "of his soul; this was the ocean to which all his religious affections\n",
      "tended: this was the object which engaged his eager desires and earnest\n",
      "pursuits: he knew no true happiness, but this: this was what he longed\n",
      "for most vehemently and constantly on _earth_; and this was with\n",
      "him the beauty and blessedness of heaven, to be perfectly holy, and\n",
      "perfectly exercised in the holy employments of heaven; to glorify God,\n",
      "and enjoy him for ever.\n",

      "*His religious affections were attended with _evangelical humiliation_;\n",
      "consisting in a sense of his own insufficiency, and despicableness.\n",

      "religion; with his vast distance from that spirituality that became him;\n",
      "with his ignorance, deadness, unsteadiness, barrenness? He was not only\n",
      "affected with the remembrance of his former sinfulness, but with the\n",
      "sense of his present vileness. He was not only disposed to think meanly\n",
      "of himself as _before God_; but among men, and compared with them.\n",
      "He was apt to think ♦other saints better than he; yea, to look upon\n",
      "himself as the least of saints; yea, the vilest and worst of mankind,\n",
      "And notwithstanding his great attainments in spiritual knowledge, yet\n",

      "resembling the lamb-like, dove-like Spirit of Christ! How full of love,\n",
      "meekness, quietness, forgiveness, and mercy! His love was not fondness\n",
      "for a party, but universal; often exercised to his greatest opposers\n",

      "painful deeds of kindness; readily confessing faults under the greatest\n",

      "and past sins, and less conscientious with respect to future sins,\n",
      "more easy in the neglect of duties that are troublesome, less apt to\n",
      "be alarmed at his own defects, and more easily induced to a compliance\n",
      "with carnal appetites! On the contrary, how tender was his conscience!\n",
      "how apt was his heart to smite him! how greatly was he alarmed at the\n",
      "appearance of evil! how great and constant was his jealousy over his\n",
      "own heart! how strict his care and watchfulness against sin! how deep\n",
      "and sensible were the wounds that sin made in his conscience! Those\n",
      "evils that are generally accounted small, were almost an insupportable\n",
      "burden to him; such as his inward deficiencies, his having no more\n",
      "love to God, any slackness or dulness, any unsteadiness, or wandering,\n",
      "how did the consideration of such things as these abase him, and fill\n",
      "him with shame and confusion! His love and hope, though they cast\n",
      "out a servile fear of hell, yet were attended with, and promoted a\n",
      "reverential filial fear of God, a dread of sin, and of God’s holy\n",

      "for sin: holy mourning with him, was not only the work of an hour or\n",
      "a day, at his first conversion; but he was a mourner for sin all his\n",
      "days. He did not, after he received forgiveness, forget his past sins,\n",
      "committed before his conversion; but the remembrance of them from time\n",
      "to time, filled his heart with renewed grief: and how lastingly did the\n",
      "sins committed after his conversion, affect and break his heart! If he\n",
      "did any thing whereby he thought he had dishonoured God, he had never\n",
      "done with calling it to mind with sorrow: though he was assured that\n",
      "God had forgiven it, yet he never forgave himself.\n",

      "good families and eminent piety, whose chief study it was to train up\n",
      "their children in the knowledge of God and his ways, according to the\n",
      "established religion of the _church_ of _England_.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was born in the same island on the 28th of _February, 1751_, under\n",
      "the happy circumstance of having parents, who as they were wanting\n",
      "in no act of care and tenderness to their offspring, so took care in\n",
      "particular to make them like young _Timothy_, acquainted from their\n",
      "infancy with the _holy scriptures_. In the earliest dawn of reason\n",
      "she discovered an extraordinary capacity and uncommon understanding;\n",
      "a great willingness to learn; and a desire of being instructed, which\n",
      "often occasioned her to ask the most pertinent questions. Such a\n",
      "genius was observed by her parents with much gratitude, to him who is\n",
      "the author and dispenser of every good and perfect gift. Her natural\n",
      "disposition was a mixture of good and evil. She was a strict observer\n",
      "of truth, which appeared to arise from a nobleness of mind, which made\n",
      "her incapable of those meannesses from whence the vice of falshood\n",
      "springs. But as every flower in nature’s garden, however blooming\n",
      "needs improving, so did this principle in her; for as it was productive\n",
      "of some virtues, so it no less occasioned the greatest blemishes in\n",
      "her temper; such as high-spiritedness, pride and self-will; which\n",
      "notwithstanding the shining example of her parents, and their care to\n",
      "restrain, would, while she was very young often gain an ascendency.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 1757, her father and mother made a voyage to _England_,\n",
      "(bringing this daughter and their other children with them) entirely\n",
      "upon a religious account, and in order to enjoy the company of some\n",
      "who were esteemed persons of remarkable piety and extensive usefulness,\n",
      "and with them to partake of those sacred privileges, with which their\n",
      "native island was not yet favoured. During their residence in _England_,\n",
      "she shewed the greatest delight in reading religious books, and in\n",
      "receiving the instruction of serious Christians, who were frequently\n",
      "entertained at her father’s house. So that what was recorded of the\n",
      "royal psalmist, might be asserted of her, _All_ her _delight was in the\n",

      "he, with his family left _England_, in the beginning of the year 1759,\n",
      "taking with them a person whose sentiments and abilities they approved\n",
      "of, to whose care they committed the education of their children, for\n",
      "whom their daughter Mary soon contracted a very tender affection; far\n",
      "from shunning the company of one that was to correct her faults, and\n",
      "whose presence must restrain the little levities of childhood. She for\n",
      "these very reasons, delighted in being constantly confined with her,\n",
      "even in those hours which she might have spent at play with her sisters.\n",
      "These seasons she employed in improving her mind, and having the\n",
      "liberty of retiring into a closet within her governess’s chamber, she\n",
      "would continue in it for a long time every day reading, praying, and\n",
      "meditating, and her remarks upon what she read, were often just, and\n",
      "instructive.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as she had learned to write, she seldom failed noting down\n",
      "whatever appeared useful in any author she read; and having a very\n",
      "retentive memory, she stored it with scripture truths, so that many of\n",
      "her relatives and others, were greatly surprised at her readiness in\n",
      "repeating, and finding out almost any text in those sacred pages. She\n",
      "likewise wrote several books of well collected texts, in proof of some\n",
      "of the _fundamental doctrines_ of the church of England, such as, _The\n",
      "fallen state of man, the necessity of repentance, of the new birth, and\n",
      "of holiness_. Before she was twelve years of age, she corresponded with\n",
      "some persons in England, and her letters were much admired; tho’ as she\n",
      "grew older, her stile greatly improved, so that she had acquired both\n",
      "an easy and elegant manner of addressing different persons, and upon\n",
      "various occasions, tho’ religion was her constant theme: herein, as in\n",
      "other instances, endeavouring to redeem as much as possible the golden\n",
      "moments of her contracted span.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus she gently and profitably passed five years of her pilgrimage,\n",
      "without variation, and exempt from vicissitudes under her parents\n",
      "roof, till in the year 1764, they thought it most for her advantage to\n",
      "send her to _England_, to finish her education. Here she arrived the\n",
      "28th of May that year: from that time boarding with an aunt, and being\n",
      "under the care of the same tutoress, who had before gone with her to\n",
      "_Antigua_. This separation from the best of parents, could not but\n",
      "prove an afflictive circumstance to one of her great sensibility, and\n",
      "who was a most dutiful and affectionate child; but this was alleviated\n",
      "by the pleasing hopes they gave her, that they themselves would\n",
      "soon come and reside in England, a thought which as it enabled her\n",
      "chearfully to bear their absence, so it animated her to a more than\n",
      "ordinary improvement of time, in order to render them the utmost\n",
      "satisfaction, when she should have the happiness of being restored to\n",
      "them; a period, which she often mentioned with the greatest delight;\n",
      "but which the infinitely wise disposer of events saw right never to\n",
      "indulge her with. It was with great pleasure that we observed, as her\n",
      "years increased, her good understanding, and the power of religion\n",
      "entirely prevailed over those tempers, which have before been mentioned,\n",
      "so that she became, every day more amiable, and was more endeared to\n",
      "all that knew her. On the first of January 1765, she began to keep\n",
      "a diary, chiefly consisting of the Lord’s dealings with her soul.\n",
      "This will give a juster conception of her understanding in the way\n",
      "of godliness, of her improvement of time, and the propriety of her\n",
      "sentiments on many occasions, than any thing that could be said upon\n",
      "the subject. She was one of those happy few, who are not afraid of\n",
      "being singularly pious, and was deeply convinced that the service\n",
      "of God is no impediment to, but the greatest augmentation of true\n",
      "happiness, in every period and circumstance of life. She had learned to\n",
      "disdain the follies of the world, always chusing plainness and neatness\n",
      "in dress, rather than gaiety and extravagance, and preferring an\n",
      "hour’s solitude, spent in communing with her own heart, or in searching\n",
      "the word of God, before all those trifling amusements, which so much\n",
      "engross the attention, and waste the time of the generality of persons\n",
      "of all ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus though young in years, she contemplated her latter end, and\n",
      "applied her heart unto true wisdom, and is now reaping the vast\n",
      "advantage in a blest eternity. She was so exercised in the needful\n",
      "duty of self-inspection, as to discern the imperfection of her best\n",
      "performances, and utterly to disclaim every other hope of obtaining the\n",
      "divine favour than that built on the sure foundation, Jesus Christ and\n",
      "him crucified. An interest in his atoning blood, was what she sincerely\n",
      "sought after; being truly sensible of the necessity of being born again,\n",
      "before we can enter into the kingdom of heaven. She thought the time\n",
      "long ere she was admitted into the glorious liberty of the children of\n",
      "God; and would greatly deplore her own instability, levity, and want of\n",
      "earnestness, to which she attributed her Lord’s delay; but these things\n",
      "tho’ felt by her tender and enlightened conscience, did not appear\n",
      "to others. And the Lord was not slack concerning his promise, as her\n",
      "following experience proved, when he came suddenly to the temple of\n",
      "her heart, never to leave her more. Some weeks before her last sickness\n",
      "she told a friend, that she had been greatly led out in the meditation\n",
      "of death, that she formerly considered it as very dreadful, but had\n",
      "of late seen it in a different view: so that if it would please God to\n",
      "finish his work in her soul, she could be content, young as she was,\n",
      "to give up all that were dear below, in hope of receiving them again\n",
      "in that eternal day. A few days before her disorder seized her, being\n",
      "asked by a friend, concerning the state of her soul, she said, “she\n",
      "had a confidence that God would not long with-hold the blessing, that\n",
      "she soon should know his pardoning love, and, that she was patiently\n",
      "waiting upon him.” As soon as she was taken ill, (which was on the 10th\n",
      "of January, 1768,) she was asked how she found her mind? She replied,\n",
      "“Quite composed, that she believed the Lord had visited her in love,\n",
      "and that whether it terminated in life, or death, it would be greatly\n",
      "to her advantage.” During the whole time of her illness not a doubt\n",
      "seemed to disturb her, nor did she ever lose her stedfast hope, that\n",
      "if she was taken, the Lord would perfect his work in her soul. She was\n",
      "also endued with a constant spirit of prayer, and to all around behaved\n",
      "with the utmost patience and meekness. She seldom complained, and\n",
      "declared she had not a murmuring thought, tho’ she appeared to suffer\n",
      "exquisitely; her disorder being a putrid fever, with a sore throat,\n",
      "which mortified some days before her dissolution: it was likewise\n",
      "attended with a deafness that encreased gradually, till at last there\n",
      "was no conversing with her. She was also deprived very early of speech,\n",
      "which as she retained her senses, rendered her situation very trying,\n",
      "as well as deprived her friends of that profit and satisfaction, which\n",
      "might otherwise have been expected. But on Thursday the 14th, (before\n",
      "the disease had made so great a progress, tho’ even then her speech was\n",
      "thick, and her hearing dull) she desired the whole family, would come\n",
      "and pray with her, and to some of her friends made this good confession:\n",
      "that she had found Christ, that she loved God, knowing that he had\n",
      "first loved her, that she was now neither afraid nor unwilling to die;\n",
      "and that she experienced unspeakable, and till now, unknown happiness.\n",
      "From this time she spoke but little, except about two days afterwards,\n",
      "when she said to one who desired her to speak to her, that she was\n",
      "perfectly resigned to the divine will; this she uttered with difficulty,\n",
      "and could add no more. But tho’ her lips were thus closed to all\n",
      "below, it was evident, her heart was open to God in prayer, which was\n",
      "discernable from the frequent lifting up of her hands and eyes with\n",
      "great devotion; in this posture she sweetly yielded up her spirit on\n",

      "are more earnest, and I have a more watchful spirit during the day:\n",
      "if I deceive myself, the Lord knoweth it is not willingly. I sincerely\n",

      "of this instability? Lord shew it to me for Jesus’s sake, tho’ not for\n",
      "mine, and make me in earnest. I found my soul something quickened at\n",

      "_Mark v. 36._\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday 31. I was much tempted to fretfulness this morning, but thro’\n",

      "Monday, February 3. When I awoke this morning, I found an earnest\n",
      "desire to spend the day to the glory of God. I soon found myself\n",
      "stripped of all my strength, and a trifling spirit prevailed over me.\n",

      "reason of a bad cold. And as to the state of my soul, I know not what\n",
      "to say. Sometimes I have been groaning under my unbelief; sometimes\n",
      "cold and dead, yet I find a hope left, that I, even I, shall yet\n",
      "rejoice in the God of my salvation: that I shall find his favour, and\n",
      "taste an earnest of eternal bliss; _Amen_, Lord Jesus. But Lord make me\n",

      "\n",
      "Sunday 9. This morning being hindered attending the public means, I\n",
      "spent some time in private, and I found the Lord was willing to hear\n",
      "and answer prayer, for he enlarged my heart in that duty, and enabled\n",
      "me to pray with life and fervency; blessed be his name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sunday 16. This day I found much sweetness and enlargement in private\n",
      "duty, and my mind was in some measure staid on God. O for an heart\n",
      "to praise and love him for this, and all his mercies! The rest of the\n",
      "week I found my soul blest at different times, with a desire to wait\n",
      "upon God in private: it was profitable to me: which indeed I need never\n",

      "Friday 28. When I awoke this morning, I felt a thankfulness to God\n",
      "for safely bringing me to see the end of my fifteenth year, and for an\n",
      "earnest desire to spend the remainder of a short life to his glory. How\n",
      "time flies? It was but the other day since I was but a little infant,\n",
      "utterly unable to help myself: in this tender state the Lord provided\n",
      "me good parents and kind friends, whose constant care it has been,\n",
      "to train me up for heaven, and to dedicate me to him betimes. Now\n",
      "I am come to years of reason, should it not be my one endeavour, my\n",
      "constant aim to glorify God in my body and in my spirit, which are his\n",
      "by creation and redemption, as also by the early dedication which my\n",
      "dear parents made of me to him? Should I not from my heart ratify and\n",
      "confirm by my own act and deed, that which they promised on my behalf?\n",
      "Lord I am willing, I am truly willing so to do. _Jesus_ Lord lend me\n",
      "thine aid, and I will devote myself to thee, body, soul, and spirit,\n",
      "a living sacrifice. Lend me thine aid, and I will take thee for my\n",
      "prophet, to teach me; my priest to atone for my sins, and my king to\n",

      "Monday, March 3. This week I have been confined by a severe cold,\n",
      "however I have not been remiss in private duties, though I have found\n",
      "little life in them. A sort of stupidity has overspread my mind, which\n",
      "has made me unfit for any duty. This I can account for no other way\n",
      "than by my disorder, which always throws me into this dull frame. O\n",
      "how this vile body weighs down the soul! How happy are those who are\n",
      "delivered from it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sunday 16. This week as well as the former I have found my heart as\n",
      "cold, dead, and hard as it was possible; nor even has it been broke or\n",
      "softened while waiting upon the Lord either in private prayer, or under\n",
      "the word. On Friday evening at the watch-night, I found my mind very\n",
      "wandering, but towards the latter end it was more composed, and I\n",
      "really believe the Lord waited to be gracious to me, but my unbelieving\n",
      "heart put the blessing away, by thinking I was not worthy! O my God,\n",
      "when shall I be worthy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sunday 23. I found my heart greatly melted in the afternoon while I was\n",
      "meeting my band, and at some liberty afterwards in private prayer, but\n",
      "my old companion coldness returned in the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thursday 27. As we were going to chapel this evening, a parcel of\n",
      "genteel well-dressed boys set upon us, throwing dirt in such a manner\n",
      "as almost blinded us, and hallowing and hooting after us. O what enmity\n",
      "is in the heart of man against every thing that is good even when\n",
      "children? O how gracious has God been to me, that I have never been\n",
      "taught to despise and treat any person ill, either on account of any\n",
      "natural infirmities, or of the religion they profess; but from my\n",
      "earliest infancy have I been trained up in the nurture and admonition\n",
      "of the Lord: how will this enhance my condemnation, if I make not a\n",
      "right use of these privileges!\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday 28. Being Good-Friday, I spent more time than usual in reading\n",

      "\n",
      "Wednesday, April 2. The Rev. Mr. _Wesley_ gave us his company to tea,\n",
      "and afterwards preached on _Romans viii. 33, 34_. I found my mind very\n",
      "wandering. The next evening he preached again on _John v. 8, 9_. Jesus\n",
      "_saith unto him, rise take up thy bed and walk_. I found a blessing\n",
      "this evening though I sought it not as I ought. O what a good God is\n",

      "Friday 4. This day I was very light and trifling; but in the afternoon\n",
      "the Lord was again pleased to stir me up, by the means of our maid, who\n",
      "this day found the Lord in communicating with a sick woman. O my God,\n",
      "what a slow progress do I make? Others find Jesus, but alas! for me, I\n",
      "find him not. I was also much blest in the evening while Mr. _Wesley_\n",
      "was preaching on these words, _John xvii. 3_. _This is eternal life_,\n",
      "&c.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saturday 5. I set apart this day, in order to seek the Lord by prayer\n",
      "and meditation; and although I did not find him, so as to enable me\n",
      "to rejoice in him, as a pardoning God, yet I found him enlarging my\n",
      "heart in prayer, enabling me to plead his promises, and to cry to him\n",
      "for mercy, without which I clearly see I am undone for ever. “I give\n",
      "up every plea beside, Lord I am damned, but Christ has died.” Lord,\n",
      "thou hast said, I _came not to call the righteous, but sinners to\n",

      "Thy sins be forgiven thee? Or to say, Arise and walk?_\n",
      "\n",
      "Sunday 6. This morning I found my desires very earnest for the blessing,\n",
      "while Mr. _Wesley_ was preaching on _Isaiah xxxv. 8_. _And a highway\n",
      "shall be there, and a way_, &c. And also afterwards while he was\n",

      "come to the Lord, while Mr. _Wesley_ was inviting us to _come and drink\n",
      "of the water of life freely_, but still I had not power to accept the\n",
      "invitation. We afterwards had a comfortable love-feast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sunday 13. I arose pretty early and went to the preaching. I afterwards\n",
      "found great sweetness, in meditating on the love of God to sinners, and\n",
      "his willingness to receive them upon their sincere repentance, as also\n",
      "in private prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wednesday 16. All this day I was very melancholy, which was chiefly\n",
      "occasioned by recollecting the sorrowful scene I saw that day two-years;\n",
      "when I had the last sight of those whom I love as my own soul. O how\n",
      "many unforeseen events have happened in that time! Some of them have\n",
      "been very trying to me, and made me repent leaving my native land: yet\n",
      "now I see they were all working together for my good, and I trust I\n",
      "have no cause to repent, seeing my soul has much prospered since I have\n",
      "been at this place, whereas I did not gain, but rather lost ground,\n",
      "while I was in _London_ and _Kendal_. How wisely does God order all\n",
      "things for the benefit of his poor undeserving creatures: and how\n",
      "ungrateful are we, not to render him the tribute of an heart and life\n",
      "devoted to his service!\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday 18. Mr. _M――――_ kept a watch-night and preached on these\n",
      "alarming words. _At midnight there was a cry made: Behold the\n",
      "bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him._ _Matthew xxv. 6_. I found\n",
      "my soul much blest under one of his prayers. O may I have oil in my\n",

      "of our Lord’s _Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out_.\n",
      "_John vi. 37_. I found myself much encouraged to come to the Lord,\n",

      "Jesus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuesday 22. This day I found great backwardness to private duty, but\n",
      "was enabled to break through and found the Lord as good as his word,\n",
      "_They that wait upon_ him _shall renew their strength_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wednesday 23. I found much sweetness and enlargement in private duty\n",
      "this day, and was in a measure blest, while meeting my class in the\n",

      "am I so to do!\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday 25. I found myself much grieved upon account of having given\n",
      "way to levity. O how prone am I to this evil! Lord, help me against\n",
      "it, or I fear it will sink me lower than the grave. I spent my evening\n",

      "as yet I am like a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke. O Lord, help me\n",

      "truly convinced that till then, I shall never find rest to my poor soul.\n",

      "Thursday 29. I went to five o’clock preaching. As I went my heart\n",

      "\n",
      "Thursday, May 1. Going a little earlier than usual to preaching, I took\n",
      "out my little bible, and found a peculiar sweetness in reading the lv.\n",
      "chapter of _Isaiah_.\n",

      "Sunday 4. I was much cast down by hearing that my poor papa was in a\n",
      "bad state of health; but was comforted by this consideration, that if\n",
      "I made God my father and my friend, nothing but my own unfaithfulness\n",

      "found great sweetness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wednesday 7. I was disappointed going to preaching, which was a cross\n",
      "to me at first; but I was so blest while meeting my class, that the\n",
      "loss was abundantly made up; my heart was softened and melted for my\n",
      "past offences, and at the same time a comfortable hope sprung up, that\n",
      "the Lord would have mercy even upon me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday 9, and Saturday 10. I can’t say, that I found my soul so much\n",

      "cause I know not, but whatever it is, I trust the Lord will discover it\n",
      "to me, and remove it. On Saturday evening I was greatly shocked at the\n",
      "melancholy account of the death of two of my uncles; and Satan strongly\n",
      "suggested that my dear Papa would soon follow. This hindered me from\n",
      "sleeping great part of the night. Every such alarming providence should\n",

      "lamentations pierced my heart! I endeavoured to comfort her, but all\n",
      "in vain; all her cry was, if she did but know his soul was happy, then\n",

      "Surely it is a grievous thing to lose a tender parent. O may I not\n",
      "by my sins, provoke God to lay the same affliction upon me. Alas! it\n",
      "would be a heavy stroke. I know not how I should bear it; I fear I\n",
      "should murmur against the hand that inflicted it, unless preserved\n",
      "therefrom by the restraining grace of God. My mind was now far from\n",
      "the comfortable frame it was in the last week; it was so confused,\n",
      "that I could not for one quarter of an hour keep it stayed on God.\n",
      "But notwithstanding this, I took up my cross, and used private prayer\n",
      "constantly. Indeed I was often tempted to think, I had better let it\n",
      "alone, for I was only mocking God by drawing near to him with my lips,\n",
      "while my heart was far from him. If this was the case it was not with\n",
      "my desire or approbation. The Lord knoweth, I would have prayed better\n",
      "if I could. I would fain have my lips, and heart, and life go together\n",
      "in his service; and therefore since he has put this desire into my\n",
      "heart, he will graciously pardon what has been amiss, and enable me to\n",

      "Thursday 22. This morning I went to my aunt _B――――s_, where I spent\n",
      "the day very agreeably. In the evening I was much blest, while my uncle\n",
      "was preaching on _John i. 11, 12_. _He came unto his own, but his own\n",
      "received him not: but as many as received him, to them gave he power\n",

      "Sunday 25. In the evening Mr. _M――――_ made a sweet Discourse on _Acts\n",

      "power to believe, I found the blessing nigh; but O my faithless heart\n",
      "drew back and lost the precious pearl. Unbelief again prevailed and\n",
      "left me helpless, but blessed be God, not a hopeless sinner. I still\n",

      "me. O for power to resist and overcome!\n",

      "Tuesday 3. I found my soul exceedingly blest this day, especially in\n",
      "the evening: such hope and confidence I had that the Lord would reveal\n",
      "himself that I had no doubt of it, and such a sweet calm was upon my\n",
      "spirit till I went to bed as I never experienced before. I was also\n",

      "words, _Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish_. _Luke xiii. 5._\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday 6. My mind was distracted with wandering thoughts, but the\n",

      "\n",
      "Sunday 8. I went to church expecting the Sacrament, but there being\n",
      "none, we had a sermon on _Galatians vi. 9_. It was a very pretty\n",
      "discourse, shewing what well-doing was; but nothing of a change of\n",

      "God’s right-hand. The rest of the week, my mind was in much confusion,\n",
      "by reason of removing; but still I have found power to be constant in\n",
      "private duty, and to resist all temptations to the contrary. By thus\n",

      "much blest under Mr. _R――――_’s preaching: his text was in _Romans viii.\n",

      "yet generally quickened in private prayer, especially one evening I\n",

      "1. TO set the doctrine of Christian perfection too high, is the ready\n",
      "way to drive it out of the world. Let a man only describe it, as\n",
      "implying a freedom from mistakes and human infirmities; and whoever\n",
      "knows there is no such freedom in this life, naturally concludes,\n",
      "“There is no perfection.” Hence we should always carefully guard\n",
      "against this, by insisting, it is no more and no less, than giving\n",
      "God all our heart: loving him with all our heart, and our neighbour\n",
      "as ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. This is well consistent with a thousand infirmities, which belong to\n",
      "every soul while in the body. To place this in the clearest and fullest\n",
      "light, I have published the following extract from the artless journal\n",
      "of a plain woman, wrote merely for her own use. I have no doubt, but\n",
      "God had all her heart. But yet how many were her infirmities! And\n",
      "these are the more apparent, because she was a person of no uncommon\n",
      "endowments; one that had just plain, natural understanding, without any\n",
      "advantage of education, and who wrote down daily just what she felt,\n",
      "with all possible artlessness and simplicity. The chief of these are,\n",
      "wandering thoughts (whether natural or preter-natural:) listlessness\n",
      "in private prayer (I believe, entirely owing to bodily disorder:) hurry\n",
      "in business (it seems, not apparent to others, though frequently felt\n",
      "by herself:) want of a steddy, invariable advertence to the presence\n",
      "of God: speaking too many words, more than were strictly necessary:\n",
      "speaking through ignorance, a word not strictly true: speaking\n",
      "sometimes too quick, so as to have the appearance of anger: omission\n",
      "of things which had better be done. Perhaps one might mention likewise\n",
      "under this head, such vehement temptations to anger, to impatience, to\n",
      "fretfulness, to immoderate sorrow, and to follow her own will, that at\n",
      "divers times she escaped with the skin of her teeth, and scarce knew\n",
      "whether she escaped or not. So particular a detail of these things,\n",
      "may be of singular use to those who find the same temptations: and who\n",
      "may be encouraged hereby, to _hold the beginning of their confidence\n",
      "stedfast unto the end_.\n",

      "3. But it may be objected, “If perfection means only that love which\n",
      "is consistent with all these infirmities, then how does it differ from\n",
      "what is experienced by every believer?” I answer, 1. Many are delivered\n",
      "from these infirmities, in a far greater measure than she was. I judge\n",
      "her to have been a real witness of Christian perfection, but only in a\n",
      "_low degree_. 2. Whom do you know that experiences even what she did,\n",
      "that never-failing love of God and man, that uninterrupted calmness of\n",
      "mind, that invariable meekness, gentleness, humility? That continual\n",
      "hunger and thirst after righteousness after the entire image of God?\n",
      "Above all, that absolute, unreserved dependence upon Christ, as the\n",
      "fountain of every good and perfect gift, of all holiness and happiness?\n",
      "Does every believer experience this? I will be bold to say, not one\n",
      "in a thousand. I suppose not one upon earth, unless he has received\n",
      "another gift, widely different from what he received when he was\n",
      "justified. At least I know no one in the three kingdoms, who comes up\n",
      "to this experience, (besides a few in their first love,) unless after\n",
      "justification he has found a second change wrought in a moment. However,\n",
      "concerning that circumstance we need not dispute, whether it be wrought\n",
      "gradually or instantaneously. Only let the change be wrought. Only let\n",
      "our souls be renewed in the whole image of God. Only let all that mind\n",
      "be in us, which was also in Christ Jesus: let him reign in our hearts\n",
      "without a rival; at all times and in all places. Let us be all devoted\n",
      "to him in soul and in body: and let all our thoughts, and words,\n",
      "and actions, be continually offered up to God, as holy sacrifices\n",
      "acceptable to God through Christ.\n",

      "4. A few more circumstances relating to this amiable woman, may not\n",
      "be unacceptable to the reader. _Elizabeth_, the daughter of _William_\n",
      "and _Joan Tuck_, was born at _Penzance_, _December 20, 1734_. She was\n",
      "brought to _Redruth_, when about four years old, and as she grew up,\n",
      "lived as other harmless people did. _June 30, 1755_, she was married to\n",
      "one _Andrew Harper_, a shopkeeper of _Redruth_; and three or four years\n",
      "after, she became weak and sickly. At the same time she grew distrest\n",
      "in her mind, which she strove to remove by various ways; but all to\n",
      "no purpose. In the latter end of the year 1763, a fever brought her to\n",
      "the brink of eternity. She was greatly afraid to die: and hearing there\n",
      "were some in the town, who had no fear of death, she intreated her\n",
      "husband, without delay, to send for one of the preachers. Conversing\n",
      "with him, she saw the way of conquering the fear of death. She soon\n",
      "recovered her health, and from that time sought the Lord with her whole\n",
      "heart, till on _Easter-day_ (having joined the society before) as she\n",
      "was receiving the Lord’s supper, these words were strongly applied to\n",
      "her soul, _It is God that justifieth: who is he that condemneth?_ She\n",
      "went home, called her husband, and said, “Now all my sins are forgiven.\n",

      "zealous in his cause. There was nothing in her power, which she was not\n",
      "ready to do for the servants or children of God. She was exceedingly\n",
      "tempted, after she believed God had cleansed her from inbred sin. Of\n",
      "this she gives a large account in her journal: but she did not cast\n",
      "away her confidence. When she saw death approaching, she was not moved,\n",
      "but calmly looked up to God. She exhorted her husband, and all near her,\n",
      "not to love the world, or the things of the world. A little after she\n",
      "said, “_Lord, thou knowest all things: thou knowest that I love thee._\n",

      "Jesus! Come, and sanctify me throughout, spirit, soul and body! O come\n",

      "Sunday 15. God was pleased this week to afflict my body with sickness.\n",

      "upon me, in being leader of a band? But these doubts did not trouble\n",
      "me so much as the close reflections I had from my husband. Twice I wept\n",
      "concerning it; but then I thought, _the sorrow of the world worketh\n",

      "I had strong faith, that, through the blood of the Lamb, I should one\n",

      "in reproving: But I looked to the Lord, and was saved. And I was kept\n",

      "better in body to-day, and have been able to pour out my soul to God,\n",
      "more freely than for some time past. Indeed for some time I have had\n",
      "little life in prayer: But, blessed be God, he even then gave me power,\n",
      "which I had not, when I could rejoice to go to prayer, and found it\n",
      "sweet to my taste. He only knows, what is best for us. And when I\n",
      "was tried to-day, he gave me a meek and quiet spirit. But I believe I\n",

      "it came, _Who maketh thee to differ?_ For a moment I sunk almost into\n",

      "calm as if I was out of the body. In the evening, while I was earnest\n",
      "in private prayer, I felt as it were a dart shot through me. I started\n",
      "a little, but still kept calling upon God, till I was more than\n",
      "conqueror.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saturday 8. This evening I was obliged to speak on behalf of the\n",
      "injured. And I thought it my duty to speak sharply, though still in\n",

      "Sunday, September 9. I was closely tried from a near quarter: But I was\n",
      "kept in peace. I wept to myself, to think of the sore bondage sin had\n",

      "uncertainty of all things but the love of Christ.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sunday 29. I was disturbed soon after midnight, and again a little\n",
      "before day. I did not wake any more, till almost six. I was grieved to\n",
      "be disappointed of the preaching, and yet contented, seeing there was\n",
      "no will of my own in the omission of it. All this day I had a solemn\n",
      "time. My soul enjoyed peace and tranquillity, and I found it good, to\n",

      "\n",
      "Thursday, October 1. When the select society met, I was much tired,\n",
      "and very heavy. But the Lord was pleased to bless others in a glorious\n",
      "manner. Immediately it was suggested, “This is false fire: or why\n",
      "am not _I_ affected!” I begged the Lord, to answer for himself. And,\n",
      "before we parted, I had the petition I asked of him, and was refreshed\n",

      "Saturday 3. Being much disordered in body, I was obliged to lie down.\n",
      "I dreamed I was exhorting some people of note, in an exceeding solemn\n",
      "manner. And I was so happy in God, that I afterward felt the good\n",
      "effect of it, even upon my body. Yet, in the end, methought I was\n",

      "Tuesday 6. I had strong desires to be filled with God, and I find faith\n",
      "that I shall; that I shall be entirely devoted to God, and that every\n",
      "moment. My heart is more enlarged in love to all mankind, particularly\n",
      "to my brethren; and I have power to cover their faults with love, and\n",
      "to pray for them. Blessed be God, that his work is spreading among\n",
      "us: More and more are brought to the knowledge of God: And many are\n",
      "going from house to house, to call upon God and tell of his goodness.\n",
      "It is no wonder therefore that Satan rages: But I trust he will be\n",

      "Sunday 18. Glory be to God, I find the fruits of the Spirit encreasing;\n",

      "at me therein, striving to make me afraid, till I sometimes cry out,\n",

      "and immediately the Lord showers down his blessings upon me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though I have been kept by sickness from the public means, this has\n",

      "my soul with his love: particularly, when I have been favoured with\n",
      "the company of his dear children. When they called upon him in prayer,\n",
      "he was pleased to hear, and answer even while they were calling. In\n",
      "general, I have found calm composure of spirit, a deliverance from my\n",
      "own will, patience and resignation to the will of God, and power in\n",
      "the hour of temptation. But I want more strength of faith and love; for\n",
      "I find the enemy is always watching. And sometimes he comes very near,\n",
      "striving to sow the evil seed again. But, glory be to God, he has saved\n",
      "me yet, though sometimes I have been scarcely saved: So that I see I\n",

      "Monday 2. When I waked, my husband soon began talking to me about\n",
      "worldly business. It was lawful, but I quickly found it was not\n",
      "expedient: For I had not so much power to pray as usual. But, in the\n",
      "evening, blessed be God, I waited upon him in a sweet, calm peace, at\n",
      "the preaching. Only I found a little reasoning, “What if I should fall\n",
      "in labour?” But it was quickly removed: And though my body failed a\n",
      "little, yet I was freer from wandrings than I ever was for a long time.\n",

      "of what I desire to be. In the morning I find strong desires to be\n",
      "wholly devoted to God in every thing. But in the evening, I find I have\n",
      "still come short, though without condemnation and fear. Blessed be God,\n",
      "I am kept from inordinate sorrow for my dear friend’s illness. Lord,\n",
      "prepare me for the same hour. And, if it be thy blessed will, rebuke\n",

      "she seemed much better. But in the evening she fell worse again, and\n",
      "this morning, about nine, departed. When word came of this, I was not\n",
      "shocked at first; but in a while I began to reason on what had passed\n",
      "between us the evening before. She then said, “When death seemed nigh\n",
      "some nights since, the enemy thrust sore at me, and said, This will be\n",
      "thy end: But I said, Not without God’s permission: He can bring me down\n",
      "to the belly of hell, and bring me up again, as he did _Jonah_ out of\n",
      "the whale’s belly. But it is one thing to talk of death, and another\n",
      "to have it brought home to us.” Then her husband, and children, and\n",
      "friends came near, and sorrow seemed to overwhelm her. But she said,\n",
      "“God is able to bless and keep them, without me, if he is pleased to\n",
      "take me. And if he is pleased to spare me, I can do nothing for them,\n",
      "without the Lord.” When I reflected upon these things, not watching\n",
      "unto prayer, I was quickly encompassed with a flood of temptations:\n",
      "So that I never remember to have passed such a night, since I knew the\n",
      "goodness of God. I could not sleep till six in the morning. But, glory\n",
      "be God, I had peace at the bottom, and continued striving with all my\n",
      "might. About Monday noon I found ease, and at five in the evening, I\n",
      "could wait upon the Lord without distraction. On Tuesday I had such a\n",
      "sweet and resigned will as I scarce ever had before. I was much taken\n",
      "up with the blessedness of heaven, and had no doubt but I should be\n",
      "there; but had no will of my own to die or live, only as the Lord\n",
      "should please, and not one reluctant thought concerning the leaving of\n",

      "sun. She was of a spirit that sympathized with every one, both in their\n",
      "temporal and spiritual trials. Indeed her own life was a life of trials;\n",
      "which, she always said, was best for her, and no more than was needful\n",

      "1. SHE was born at _Lambeth_, October 17, 1717. Her mother died while\n",
      "she was young. About sixteen, she married a seafaring man, who by his\n",
      "extravagance exposed her to many difficulties. Often in sailing from\n",
      "port to port, to prevent, if possible, his wasting his money when he\n",
      "came from sea, she was in great danger, and then made many resolutions;\n",
      "but they quickly died away.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. On February 14, 1747. Her husband brought her to _Dublin_. But\n",
      "she was still the same: “I do not remember, said she, that I had any\n",
      "thought, whether I had a soul or not, till I was about twenty-eight\n",
      "years old.” At that time she began to reflect with terror, on the\n",
      "immortality of her soul. She saw and felt, that hell was her just\n",
      "desert, and could find no way to escape it. She knew she was under the\n",
      "wrath of God, but knew not how to appease it. She went from church to\n",
      "church, and endeavoured to do whatever she was taught; but found all\n",
      "she could do was nothing. Sometimes indeed her convictions subsided\n",
      "for a time; but returned with double violence. The cry of her soul\n",
      "continually was, “Lord what must I do to be saved? Shew me the way\n",
      "wherein I should go!” Thus she went on for several years.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. About fourteen years ago she heard Mr. _Thomas Walsh_ preach in the\n",
      "New-room. She said, “He made my soul tremble exceedingly.” Her fears\n",
      "were rather increased than lessened. But the eyes of her understanding\n",
      "were not opened, with regard to the true method of salvation.\n",
      "Afterwards she heard “that blessed man of God,” (as she justly called\n",
      "him) _Paul Greenwood_. She then saw, that _by grace we are saved\n",
      "through faith_, and at the same time, sin received a mortal wound. She\n",
      "determined, nothing should prevent her seeking the pearl of great price,\n",
      "that precious faith. She had much opposition; but nothing stopped her\n",
      "soul on full stretch for salvation. Such was her desire to hear the\n",
      "word, that frequently when she was locked into the room, up one pair of\n",
      "stairs, she got out at a window. She directly joined the society, and\n",
      "counted all things loss, so she might win Christ.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. It was not long before it pleased God to remove the opposer out of\n",
      "the way. She now frequently received much comfort: but that did not\n",
      "satisfy. Nothing could give her lasting comfort, till she knew her sins\n",
      "were blotted out. This she earnestly sought both in private and public,\n",
      "missing no opportunity of hearing the preaching. And one Sunday morning,\n",
      "as Mr. _Deaves_ was giving out an hymn, God was _pleased to reveal his\n",
      "Son in_ her, and to enable her to say with a clear confidence, “He has\n",
      "loved _me_, and given himself for _me_.” It was with much difficulty\n",
      "that she refrained from crying out, and exhorting all to praise the\n",
      "Lord. She now delighted to run the way of his commandments. Her heart\n",
      "was enlarged. Both her heart and hands were open towards those that\n",
      "feared God, and had her power been equal to her will, none of them\n",
      "should have wanted any thing. For some months she walked as on the\n",
      "wings of the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "                     “Jesus all the day long\n",

      "                      He has lov’d me, she cried,\n",

      "Though her outward situation was disagreeable, being surrounded great\n",
      "part of the day, with those who constrained her to see and hear what\n",
      "her soul abhorred; yet his grace was sufficient for her, and she\n",
      "remained always rejoicing, and praising the God of her salvation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. After some months, it was shewn her, that the seeds of sin were not\n",
      "yet rooted out of her heart. Yet she did not let go her confidence in\n",
      "God, neither lose the power over her besetting sin, which was anger.\n",
      "And it was her principle, not to rest an hour, without a feeling sense\n",
      "of the love of God.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. On October the 9th, 1760, by the providence of God, she and I were\n",
      "married. She was truly an helpmate for ten years, three months, and two\n",
      "days: during which time we could truly say, there never was any thing\n",
      "but love and tenderness toward each other. There never was, that I\n",
      "remember, but once, any appearance of what is called a quarrel. And\n",
      "in a few hours she saw, it was not her business, to interfere with the\n",
      "discipline of the society.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Although there was the most tender affection between us, yet\n",
      "so exceeding great was her love to souls, and her desire for their\n",
      "welfare, that she was willing at all times for me to go to any part of\n",
      "the kingdom, without ever saying, “If you _must_ go, stay a few days\n",
      "longer.” And if I was absent three or six months, nay, a whole year,\n",
      "which was once the case, she never complained. She could part with\n",
      "husband, or any thing, to glorify him, who had done so much for her.\n",
      "The last time I spoke of leaving her, she was ill. My friends then\n",
      "advised me, not to go. I was inclined to follow their advice, as there\n",
      "appeared little hope of her recovery. But she insisted on my going\n",
      "where Providence called, saying, “I never have hindered you yet. And if\n",
      "I should do it now, I believe it would be displeasing to God.” I went,\n",
      "and after an absence of three months, returned just at the time, when\n",
      "she was taken with that last illness, which prevented her going out any\n",
      "more. And for my coming home just at that time, she praised God to her\n",
      "latest hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. During the last ten years of her life, she had many and great\n",
      "conflicts. The sense of inbred sin, and of her having so many times\n",
      "offended God, after she had known his love, often lay heavy upon her\n",
      "mind, and pierced her with deep sorrow. The earnest desire of her soul\n",
      "was, to be wholly given up to God. But she was tormented with that fear,\n",
      "lest she should not glorify God in life and in death: particularly,\n",
      "lest by any improper behaviour at her death, she should be a reproach\n",
      "to the gospel. Likewise anxious care about the world, sometimes\n",
      "exceedingly distressed her. She was tempted to fear, lest she should\n",
      "live to be a burden to the society. Or, at least, till she could not\n",
      "be helpful to others, as she knew, it was more blessed to give than to\n",
      "receive. But thro’ the mercy of God, none of the things which she had\n",
      "feared came upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Above two years ago, the disorder which occasioned her death began\n",
      "to be violent. Yet she did not abate her diligence, to support herself\n",
      "and family, till July 1769. Her pains then so increased, that she had\n",
      "no ease night or day, only when she slept, which was seldom more than\n",
      "an hour or two. But notwithstanding this, she could not be prevailed\n",
      "upon to keep her room before Christmas. From that time she was in\n",
      "exquisite pain, as tho’ her bowels were tearing asunder. She often said,\n",
      "_wearisome nights and days are appointed for me_. Yet in the sharpest\n",
      "pain, she never _charged God foolishly_, or once said, he dealt hardly\n",
      "with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. During this long confinement, she felt a keen conviction of her\n",
      "past unfaithfulness, together with a piercing sense of inbred sin.\n",
      "And on both these accounts, she was often crying out in deep distress,\n",
      "_God be merciful to me a sinner_. She steddily believed, it was the\n",
      "privilege of God’s people, always to feel the clear witness of his\n",
      "spirit. Accordingly she was always, either rejoicing in the Lord, or\n",
      "deeply distressed for want of it. Even in the severest pain, she was\n",
      "not satisfied with patience, unless she had joy in the Lord.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. She often would say, “The devil tells me, the peace I feel is only\n",
      "stupidity: that I have been an hypocrite all my life, and never was\n",
      "converted. But I can with confidence answer, this is false. I never\n",
      "desired to deceive either myself or others. I know the Lord did awaken\n",
      "my soul, and convert me to himself. And I cannot accuse myself of\n",
      "lukewarmness in my duty since. I have seldom wilfully missed my class,\n",
      "or band, or a sermon. Yet the manner in which I often performed those\n",
      "duties, causes my soul to tremble. My body was present: but often, too\n",
      "often my mind was engaged in my business. Herein I must plead guilty\n",
      "before God, and he might justly have cast me out of his presence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "12. All this time the hand of the Lord was underneath her, and did\n",
      "not suffer her to sink in the deep waters. Yet she often complained,\n",
      "“I cannot rejoice in pain,” whereas St. _Paul_ says, _Rejoice in\n",
      "tribulation_: and that happy soul, _Nancy Rogers_ said, “Every pain is\n",
      "a spring to my soul, to lift me up to heaven.” I told her, “When you,\n",
      "like _Nancy_, are near your end, you may triumph over pain also. But\n",
      "should it be otherwise, your eternal state does not depend on that.”\n",
      "She cried out, “Nay, but what the scriptures declare, and what others\n",
      "have experienced, is for _me_.” She did not fear being cast into hell:\n",
      "yet her distress, at times, was exceeding great. She was vehemently\n",
      "athirst for full salvation, and often broke out into deep lamentation.\n",
      "“I am unlike the Lord! When shall I awake up after his full likeness!”\n",
      "Sometimes she seemed just ready to lay hold on the hope set before her.\n",
      "But she was checked by a sense of her unprofitableness in the ways of\n",
      "God: and would often break out, “True Lord, true! I am unprofitable\n",
      "indeed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "13. At some times she was afraid, lest she should live to expend all\n",
      "she had, and leave me in distress. But about a month before her death,\n",
      "these fears vanished away, and she was quite resigned to the will of\n",
      "God, leaving it wholly to him to do what seemed him good, with her and\n",
      "all that she had. From this time she had no other care than that which\n",
      "related to her soul. She was now released from her severe pains, and\n",
      "her soul felt a solemn peace; tho’ she was still frequently tempted to\n",
      "fear, lest she should deceive herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Near three weeks after, I was reading in the fifteenth volume of\n",
      "the Christian Library, that section in _Isaac Ambrose_’s looking unto\n",
      "Jesus, “Desiring Jesus with respect to his death.” The Lord now turned\n",
      "his hand upon her, and caused her to feel his power. Her body seemed to\n",
      "be forgotten; while her spirit rejoiced in God her Saviour, crying out,\n",
      "“O the goodness of God, which directed that passage to be read this\n",
      "night!” Then she began to sing\n",
      "\n",
      "             “Thou shepherd of Israel and mine,\n",
      "                The joy and desire of my heart!\n",
      "              For closer communion I pine;\n",
      "                I long to reside where thou art.\n",

      "\n",
      "From this time she did _rejoice evermore_; and yet longed to triumph\n",
      "more. Her ambitious soul could not rest, till wholly swallowed up in\n",
      "God.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. January 7. She desired to be taken out of bed. As soon as her\n",
      "cloaths were on, she expected to have gone to rest. But God was\n",
      "pleased to keep her a little longer in the body, for the comfort of\n",
      "her surviving friends. As soon as she was a little revived, I asked,\n",
      "“If she could stay her soul upon the Lord?” She said, “Yes, I can, tho’\n",
      "I have not always that full assurance of faith.” But the next morning,\n",
      "God fulfilled the desire of her heart, and filled her with faith and\n",
      "love. About ten she seemed just expiring: but she soon revived. I said,\n",
      "“My dear, can you rely on the Lord?” She answered with triumph, “I can;\n",
      "yes, I can. All is plain before me. There is nothing now in the way. O\n",
      "the precious blood of God! O the precious blood of God! That precious\n",
      "blood cleanseth from all sin and from all stains.” I asked, “Has that\n",
      "blood cleansed _you_ from all stains?” She said, “Yes, yes. It has\n",
      "washed me, and it will still wash me.” I said, “For sorrow you shall\n",
      "soon have joy.” She said, “Sorrow! I have had no sorrow. When I think\n",
      "of what my Lord suffered for me, mine is nothing.” Indeed the exceeding\n",
      "happiness she now enjoyed, made her forget all her former pains. She\n",
      "said, “I shall be like him! I cannot tell what that is: but I shall be\n",
      "like him.” The convulsions then followed each other with little respite;\n",
      "but in the intervals, she was still praising God.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. Wednesday 9. In the morning she was in great agonies, but said,\n",
      "“Lord, thou dost all things well! Now I have nothing to do but to\n",
      "praise: every breath shall be praise. I have just conquered death. O\n",
      "Jesus, thou didst bring me into the world, and hast preferred me in the\n",
      "world, and hast brought me thro’ the world!” I said, “He has brought\n",
      "you safe to Jordan’s bank.” She said, “O yes, he has, O that I may go\n",
      "full sail into port! I have a blessed pilot.” This day many persons\n",
      "came to see her. One said, “Blessed are the dead which die in the\n",
      "Lord!” She replied, “So saith the Spirit: for they rest from their\n",
      "labours.” A convulsion followed, after which she was light-headed:\n",
      "unless any one spoke to her of the Lord Jesus. Then for a time, her\n",
      "reason returned. She did not sleep the whole night, and her breath\n",
      "was almost gone: yet she said, “I do not feel much pain.” Thursday 10.\n",
      "Early in the morning she was again composed, and said, “I shall soon be\n",

      "in the most exemplary manner. “My body, she said, is exceeding weak:\n",

      "expecting deliverance under every sermon I heard, and in every meeting\n",
      "for prayer. But in about two months my hope grew weak, and I concluded\n",

      "one night going to bed, I cried earnestly for mercy, and begged that if\n",
      "there were any for me, I might wake time enough to attend the morning\n",

      "of last year, (when I was hurt by disputing about a third person)\n",

      "of the Lord shone into my soul, and I felt so much of his love, it was\n",

      "of heaven.” She said, “Three nights ago I was in exquisite pain, such\n",

      "lift me up to heaven. I could thank him for all, and methought I would\n",
      "not recover for the whole world. Indeed the love of Jesus so ravishes\n",
      "my soul that I would not have ♦one pain less than he pleases.” Then\n",
      "correcting herself she said, “Pain! It cannot be called pain: his\n",
      "presence makes it heaven to me!” One said, “He has brought you through\n",
      "the wilderness, within sight of the good land.” She said, “O yes! O\n",

      "favour of my Lord: neither can I fear his casting me into hell. But I\n",

      "This lasted some hours; but in the evening she said, “Christ is come,\n",

      "I HAVE never yet had an opportunity of fully laying before you, the\n",
      "reasons of my coming to reside at this place, and the nature of my\n",
      "employment here, which I will now take the liberty to do.\n",
      "\n",

      "they would one day hear and receive the gospel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Removing from these parts in February, 1761, those thoughts were\n",
      "taken from me, for a season: but after a year and an half, being\n",
      "providentially called to return hither, the same thoughts returned into\n",
      "my mind. Yet I could not easily consent to leave _London_, till I had,\n",
      "with my friend, laid it before the Lord; being fully persuaded, that if\n",
      "it was of God, he would make plain paths for our feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after, many outward providences confirmed us, in our belief, that\n",
      "it was God’s appointment. His Spirit also shone clearer upon our souls,\n",
      "and convinced us, it was a cross which he called us to take up. One day\n",
      "in particular, when my friend and I were laying it before him in prayer,\n",
      "he condescended to assure her, that he would _not send us a warfare at\n",
      "our own charges_. I thought, _let not my Lord be angry, and I will ask_\n",
      "yet one sign more. This was the settling of an affair, which seemed to\n",
      "man impossible. And it was settled within a few days. O God, who can\n",
      "stay thy hand?\n",
      "\n",
      "But no sooner was my design mentioned to others, than it was vehemently\n",
      "opposed, one in particular charged me not to go, saying, “It was all\n",
      "a scheme of the devil.” Either that night, or the next, I dreamed\n",
      "I was at _Laton-Stone_, and a great number of all sorts of people\n",
      "about me. I was prest in spirit to speak to them; but being pained\n",
      "at the appearance of many gay ones among them, I said, in the anguish\n",
      "of my soul, “Lord, what do I here among this people?” Immediately I\n",
      "thought Jesus came down, and stood just before me. The brightness of\n",
      "his presence so overcame me, that there was no strength left in me. He\n",
      "said, “I will send you to a people, that are not a people; and I will\n",
      "go with you: bring them unto me. I will lay my hand upon them, and heal\n",
      "them: fear not; only believe.” He then disappeared, leaving me quite\n",
      "penetrated with his presence and his words. After having wept some time,\n",
      "I thought I told the people what the Lord had said. About half seemed\n",
      "serious and attentive, and desirous of being separated from the rest. I\n",
      "thought I was to find them a place to meet in: in order to which, I was\n",
      "obliged to walk over a floor no thicker than a wafer: however, I went\n",
      "over, and not a splinter gave way under my feet. Soon after I awoke\n",
      "with these words, “The mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.”\n",

      "Our fears were now removed, and on March 24, 1763, we came to this\n",

      "and in order to supply the want of the public means, from which we were\n",
      "in great measure cut off, we agreed to spend an hour every evening,\n",
      "part in reading to the family, and part in private prayers. The first\n",
      "book we read was, “The Rebuke to Backsliders, and Spur to Loiterers.”\n",

      "to prayers? I told her, she might at seven in the evening. She did so,\n",
      "as did two or three more soon after. We then appointed them to come on\n",
      "Thursday nights. In a little time they were increased to above twenty.\n",
      "We now thought it best, to talk with them, and that as closely as\n",
      "we could. Some were quickly offended and came no more. Some appeared\n",
      "convinced of sin. These we desired to come to us on Tuesday nights;\n",
      "and the second time we met, two of them found peace with God.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little before this, we judged the time was come to have public\n",
      "preaching here. This was a close trial to _me_, such as few can\n",
      "conceive, unless they have been in the same situation. But I knew,\n",
      "whosoever would not _forsake all_, could not be Christ’s disciple:\n",

      "Three of these, (two of whom are eleven years old, the other, between\n",
      "nine and ten) rise at four. One lights the nursery fire, one mine,\n",
      "the other, that below. At five, the rest of the family are called. And\n",
      "when the children are drest and have prayed, they go (in summer) in the\n",
      "garden from six till half an hour after, while the bigger ones make the\n",
      "beds, and clean the rooms. At half hour after six we all join in family\n",
      "prayer: at seven breakfast in the same room; two or three upon herb tea,\n",
      "the rest upon milk-porridge. At eight, the bell rings for school, where\n",
      "they continue till twelve; and then after a few minutes spent in prayer,\n",
      "come to us. In winter, this is their hour for exercise, instead of the\n",
      "morning and evening. In hot weather we read to them something they are\n",
      "pleased with, or converse familiarly, so as (without seeming to aim at\n",
      "it) to instil into them principles of religion, at the same time giving\n",
      "them some kind of employ, which is rather amusement than business:\n",
      "yet it just takes off the appearance of idleness. For, from the very\n",
      "beginning, they have been carefully taught, never to do any thing, but\n",
      "what they could give God a reason for. On this account we never use\n",
      "the term _play_, nor suffer any to give them those toys or play-things,\n",
      "which children are usually brought up to spend half their time in. And\n",
      "when some of these were privately given, they threw them aside without\n",
      "any bidding. Their recreation consists in diversifying their business,\n",
      "which is varied even during their school-hours. Only the very little\n",
      "ones now and then run in the garden for a quarter of an hour; but still\n",
      "with a degree of seriousness; and they know it is for their health. At\n",
      "one we dine: at two school begins again, except on Saturdays. At five\n",
      "they return to us. About six they sup. At half after six they begin\n",
      "to be washed, and at seven go to bed. Indeed in summer their supper is\n",
      "sooner, so that they have an hour with us in the garden. During this\n",
      "time they are all employed, some in watering, others in fetching the\n",
      "water, the rest in pumping. And work of this kind they are all very\n",
      "fond of.\n",
      "\n",
      "*But O! what a want of wisdom do I find! I see in them, what I cannot\n",
      "put in practice. I want the children not to be a moment from under\n",
      "the _eye_ and the _attention_ of some judicious person: so that if the\n",
      "eleven children were at work in so many different parts of the garden,\n",
      "one might observe, that each works _diligently_. For sloth in temporals\n",
      "always produces sloth in spirituals. Yet at the same time their work\n",
      "must not be a _task_; for then it would not answer the end. Again,\n",
      "their thoughts all the day long will naturally tend to evil. And their\n",
      "words will be trifling. To _bid_ them do otherwise, avails no more,\n",
      "than to bid the blackamoor be white. And to reprove them continually,\n",
      "would be a burden greater than they could bear. But if by little\n",
      "stories and hints, their minds could be insensibly drawn to better\n",
      "subjects, they would be at length brought to remember, that God is\n",
      "present, and is looking upon them every moment. When I consider this,\n",
      "and many more things, which I see afar off, but cannot bring to effect,\n",
      "I am constrained to say, “O Lord! I am not yet _throughly furnished to\n",
      "every good work_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some may say, “This is worldly wisdom, not gospel simplicity. And after\n",
      "all you cannot change their hearts.” Most certain. But hath not God\n",
      "said, _Train up a child in the way it should go_? Now I think true\n",
      "simplicity is to obey God, and leave the consequence to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we have already reason to believe, our labour has not been in vain.\n",
      "There are dawnings of grace in most of the children. Some of them God\n",
      "was pleased to bless in a particular manner, on the 7th of last June.\n",
      "In the evening, _Betty L――――_, about ten years old, was much concerned\n",
      "for one of the little ones, who had stole something. When ♦they went to\n",
      "bed, not knowing they were overheard, thy began to converse freely; and\n",
      "_Betty L――――_ said, “Let us go to prayer for _H――――_’s soul.” She then\n",
      "prayed in a very affecting manner, afterwards one about eight, prayed,\n",
      "pleading much for _H――――_, and added, “Lord, don’t let us so think\n",
      "of her sin, as to forget our own. Lord don’t let us laugh and trifle,\n",
      "and talk of foolish things when we come off our knees, but make us\n",
      "Christians.” One of them then thanked God, for their “good corrections,\n",
      "and teaching,” and said “Lord, if we are not Christians, we shall be\n",
      "more punished than others.” When they had done, _Nancy Tripp_ went\n",
      "in to undress them. She first went to prayer with them as usual, and\n",
      "the spirit of conviction fell on _Betty L――――_ in a very uncommon\n",
      "manner. We came up and found her in an exceeding great agony: she\n",
      "was the very picture of terror. The veins of her neck were as if they\n",
      "would burst. She wrung her hands, and cried with a bitter cry, “O my\n",
      "sins!” I believe more than an hundred times. She then broke out into\n",
      "such a confession of her original sin, and heart sins, as was quite\n",
      "astonishing: adding, “O! I have never done any thing for _thee_ in\n",
      "my whole life. I have broke all thy laws, I have kept the devil’s\n",
      "commandments; I have kept none of thy commandments. May such a wretch\n",
      "come to the Lord? Wilt thou receive me? Wilt thou pardon me? Wilt thou\n",
      "make me a Christian? Tell me, Lord, shall I go to heaven or hell? Shall\n",
      "I go to heaven or hell, Lord? O tell me! Shall I go to heaven or hell?\n",
      "Wilt thou make me a Christian? Wilt thou forgive me?” She then paused\n",
      "a little, and added, “But _wilt_ thou, Lord? Yes, he will, he will.\n",
      "But wilt thou Lord? Yes, thou wilt, thou wilt.” Mr. _Dornford_ then\n",
      "gave out an hymn. She now seemed quite calm: the horror which before\n",
      "appeared in her countenance was gone, and had left a sweet smile.\n",
      "Her attention seemed quite fixt. And after remaining some time with\n",
      "her eyes upward, she said, “Jesus is smiling upon me.” She had at the\n",
      "same time a sight of him as upon the cross, saying, “I have pardoned\n",
      "all your sins; and if you pray, I will give you abundant love.” After\n",
      "she had sat silent a while, she broke out, “O what a sweet Saviour he\n",
      "is! He has forgiven me all my sins――All, all. Lord, thou wilt, thou\n",
      "hast forgiven me.――O let them be perfectly forgiven! But shall I ever\n",
      "sin again, Lord? O don’t let me sin again.” Some time after, she said,\n",
      "“O what a sweet Saviour thou art! What sweet love is thine! O for more\n",
      "such love, more such love as thine! But don’t let me sin again! Fill me\n",
      "with love, that I may never sin again!”\n",

      "This scene was striking: but it was nothing to the change that followed.\n",
      "She was of a far worse natural temper, then any of the children: but\n",
      "now it might indeed be said, “Love made her willing heart in swift\n",
      "obedience move.” So great was the change both in will and understanding,\n",
      "as plainly declared the hand that wrought it.\n",

      "We sometimes hope, several of them will chuse to be entirely devoted\n",

      "produce of their labour into a common stock, and may not God be pleased\n",
      "to call some young women, not brought up with us, who have a desire to\n",
      "devote themselves wholly to God, to cast in their lot with us? Perhaps\n",
      "some who do not want, may be glad to get out of the hurry of the world,\n",
      "at least for a season, that the tender flame may not be put out, nor\n",
      "any unhallowed fires mix with it. How much is something of this kind\n",

      "we see those who are just setting out in the good way, either wholly\n",

      "the Spirit of God at first pointed out?\n",

      "frequently, when an object of distress presented, gone beyond my income,\n",
      "believing God would make it up in the time of need. In this confidence,\n",
      "I received four or five more children, though I had nothing in hand,\n",
      "and more bedding and cloaths were to be bought immediately. For this we\n",
      "wanted two guineas directly. Some friends sending us word, they would\n",
      "call on such a day; my friend prayed, that God would put it into their\n",
      "hearts to help us. They came, and one of them put two guineas into my\n",
      "hand. We praised the Lord, and received it as a token for good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after we were advised to put up a poor box. I found great\n",
      "reluctance to it, which convinced me, it requires less grace in some\n",
      "cases, to _give_ than to _receive_. However, laying it before the\n",
      "Lord in prayer, I saw it was his will, and consented. So on Tuesday,\n",
      "February 1, it was put up in the passage-room, with this inscription,\n",
      "“For the maintenance of a few poor orphans, that they may be brought up\n",
      "in the fear of the Lord.” A few days after we took out 2s. 7d. but no\n",
      "more for a great while. During this time we were much straitened, not\n",
      "having the nursery furnished, nor the necessaries for the children. It\n",
      "was now strongly suggested, “You see you have done wrong, and God will\n",
      "not help you any more.” But having recourse to prayer, our faith was\n",
      "strengthened.\n",
      "\n",

      "not rather say, “Let all I have be offered, for the necessities of my\n",
      "Lord. He is well able to repay it, and if he is not, then let us want\n",
      "together.” I saw the case with the children was the same, and that\n",
      "_what was done to one of these, was done to him_. A light broke in upon\n",
      "my mind which quite satisfied me, and constrained me to say, “Lord, thy\n",
      "word is enough, thou hast said, _Love one another as I have loved_ you:\n",
      "let their wants be mine, my substance theirs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We were now not only in want of the things above-mentioned, but of\n",
      "money to keep the house. Just then a guinea was put into the box, and\n",
      "soon after, another: in a few days one brought us thirty shillings,\n",
      "saying, “Fear not: only believe.” About the same time we received four\n",
      "guineas from another hand, which helped us through that quarter. To\n",
      "avoid tediousness, I pass over many other helps which we received from\n",

      "*Some time since, being obliged to pay a sum of money in a day’s time,\n",

      "also. Not knowing what to do, I went up stairs and waited before the\n",
      "Lord, telling him I would yet _trust_ him and _praise_ him. Opening the\n",
      "last volume of sermons, I cast my eye on this sentence, “Christ charges\n",
      "himself with all our temporal affairs, when we charge ourselves with\n",
      "those that relate to his glory.” It was applied to my heart with such\n",
      "a power, as I had very seldom felt. And such a sense of the immediate\n",
      "presence of God seized my soul as almost overwhelmed it. O what a\n",
      "freedom of spirit did I feel! I could truly say,\n",
      "\n",

      "little above the sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "*In Spring we were again reduced to about one penny, and expected a\n",
      "bill of two or three pounds to be brought in every hour. We looked\n",
      "to the Lord, and found him again to be a present help. For while we\n",
      "were consulting what to do, a basket came which one had sent us from\n",
      "_London_, with some provisions, and a little parcel, in which were four\n",
      "pounds, three shillings and ninepence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In August we had an hour of trial again. The children being increased\n",
      "to ten, we were in great want of linen; but how to procure it for\n",
      "them we could not tell. I was unwilling to run farther in debt, having\n",
      "already spent the two next quarters before they came in, nor was that\n",
      "enough to pay what was owing. And I had nothing in the house. So we\n",
      "agreed to lay it before the Lord together. While I was alone, it was\n",
      "violently suggested, “there is so much of _self_ in all you do, that\n",
      "God is rather dishonoured than glorified thereby.” I said, “Lord, I am\n",
      "the purchase of thy blood. I plead that only. And I believe thou wilt\n",
      "not leave me, nor forsake me.” Afterwards I felt much peace. Rising\n",
      "from my knees, I opened the bible on the following words. _Acquaint\n",
      "thyself now with him, and be at peace; thereby shall good come unto\n",
      "thee. Then――the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have\n",
      "plenty of silver――thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be\n",
      "established, and the light shall shine on thy ways._\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt my soul instantly strengthened. And every word was so opened and\n",
      "applied, that to this day it seems new whenever I read it: particularly\n",
      "that promise, _Thou shall decree a thing, and it shall be established,\n",
      "and the light shall shine on thy ways_. Indeed the whole appeared more\n",
      "full and strong than I have words to express.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two or three days after we received five guineas; the same day three\n",
      "more, and two from another hand. In a little while we received four\n",
      "more, with a promise of the same yearly. O my God, who would not trust\n",
      "thee? Who would not take thee at thy word?\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps some will wonder, how one who has so great an income as I, can\n",
      "ever experience want. But _you_ know what I have. You know likewise,\n",
      "that before I took any children, I every year spent more than my income,\n",
      "trusting that God would supply what was lacking. Others may wonder at\n",
      "my present _imprudent_ way of proceeding; but I _know in whom I have\n",
      "believed_. Indeed had I sought the praise of men, I should have taken\n",
      "care of myself rather than of others. For I know, _so long as thou dost\n",
      "well unto thyself, men will speak well of thee_. But we have chose the\n",

      "the glorious path you have often pointed out to me, of perfect\n",

      "bottom of every bitter cup; with what alacrity should we drink it?\n",
      "With what thankfulness, nay, with tears of joy, should we cry, Lord,\n",

      "suffering have I had in this illness? It can scarce be called suffering,\n",
      "when God sensibly supports. The suffering is when _he_ leaves the\n",

      "the promise; but asserting and proving are two things. Whatever has\n",
      "the appearance of argument in this letter may, I imagine, be reduced\n",
      "to these heads: _1st._ That it is absolutely wrong for any member of\n",
      "the church of _England_ to attend the meetings of separatists. _2dly._\n",
      "That in the church of _England_, a soul may find every thing necessary\n",
      "for its attaining the highest degrees of faith and holiness. _3dly._\n",
      "That Mr. _W._ is a separatist: and _4thly._ That your having any\n",
      "acquaintance with him, will hurt Mr. _C._ both in his temporal interest,\n",
      "and in his character as a minister.――The opinion I had conceived of\n",
      "Mr. _B._ was very high, I imagined him actuated by that spirit of\n",
      "_universal love_, which is the first and ruling principle of every\n",
      "soul that is born of God; and I make no doubt but this is his _real_\n",
      "character: however (in this affair) he may _seem_ to incline to a\n",
      "_partial selfish_ orthodoxy. *Could the church of _England_ be proved\n",
      "to be the _only church_ of _Christ_, there might be some reason for\n",
      "the cry of schism, which we hear so much of: but what is she, more\n",
      "than one of the most unexceptionable of those many divisions into which\n",
      "the universal church is broken? And therefore a separation from her,\n",
      "though causeless, or from mistaken motives, cannot properly be called\n",
      "making a schism in the _church_ of _Christ_. For my part (but I speak\n",
      "it with submission to Mr. _B._’s judgment) I apprehend, that the only\n",
      "_real_ and dangerous schism is the want of that spirit of love, which\n",
      "makes us rejoice in whatever is good and excellent in people of all\n",
      "denominations, and ready to believe good even of those who most differ\n",
      "from _us_ in ceremonies and opinion. And why a person of this spirit\n",
      "(suppose one in communion with the church of _England_) may not be\n",
      "allowed sometimes to hear a minister among the _Presbyterians_, or any\n",
      "other sect, if they find this minister’s preaching blest to their souls,\n",
      "I cannot imagine. What St. _Paul_ says in regard to giving offence to\n",
      "weak brethren, is often quoted to prove what it has nothing to do with;\n",
      "for St. _Paul_ surely does not mean, that he neglected those things\n",
      "which were profitable to _his soul_, for fear of giving offence to\n",
      "the weak; but that he refrained from outward things (such as making\n",
      "difference in meats, &c.) which he, as strong in faith, knew to be\n",
      "wholly indifferent, lest his example should tempt those who were weak\n",
      "to do things by which their consciences might be wounded.――As to Mr.\n",
      "_B._’s second argument, _in one sense_ of it, I heartily agree with\n",
      "him: the homilies, the articles, and liturgy of the church of _England_,\n",
      "doubtless contain all the doctrines necessary to faith and holiness.\n",
      "But, alas, how little are these doctrines regarded either in preaching\n",
      "or practice, by the generality of her ministers! Let any one who has\n",
      "the least degree of seriousness, look round the churches of _London_.\n",
      "Will he not see the people for the most part repeating an excellent set\n",
      "of prayers, just as a parrot repeats a song; and the minister giving\n",
      "forth doctrines from the pulpit, as directly contrary to these prayers\n",
      "as darkness is to light? This is so plain a matter of fact, that\n",
      "it cannot be contradicted; and it is _as_ notorious, that whenever\n",
      "any minister in the church of _England_ begins to preach her _real_\n",
      "doctrines, and live up to her precepts, he is immediately called a\n",
      "_Methodist_. This name is given to him as a reproach. But as it comes\n",
      "upon him for speaking the truth, it is in fact a glory. Ever since\n",
      "Christ was upon the earth, _real_ Christians have had a nick-name: but\n",
      "surely no one who is sincerely bent to follow him can regard this: I\n",
      "doubt not but Mr. _B._ himself is called a _Methodist_. But I now come\n",
      "to Mr. _B._’s third argument, that most dreadful charge laid against Mr.\n",
      "_W._ that _he is a separatist_. This charge has been repeated over and\n",
      "over again, but has never yet been clearly proved. If four walls, with\n",
      "a steeple and bells, was the church of _England_, Mr. _W._ might with\n",
      "some shadow of reason be said to have separated from it, because he\n",
      "seldom preaches in these places: but _this_ is no fault of his, for he\n",
      "will gladly preach in any of them, when their respective ministers will\n",
      "let him. And he was never denied preaching in what is called a church,\n",
      "till he strongly insisted on _that doctrine_ for which the martyrs\n",
      "of the reformation laid down their lives, and which is the very\n",
      "fundamental doctrine of the church of _England_, _justification by\n",
      "faith_. Any one who would read Mr. _W._’s _Appeals_ with a sincere and\n",
      "impartial spirit, would I believe be fully convinced, that this charge\n",
      "against him could not stand.――As to the hurt your being acquainted with\n",
      "Mr. _W._ might do to Mr. _C._ in his temporal interest, it depends\n",
      "entirely upon himself. If he preaches to his people _smooth_ things,\n",
      "and prophesies _deceits_; if he joins with them in their _innocent\n",
      "amusements_, which _lull_ souls asleep, and keeps them in an utter\n",
      "ignorance of their _fall_ and their _redemption_, till they awake in\n",
      "a miserable eternity: go _you_ where you will, not a dog will move\n",
      "its tongue against him, nor will the generosity of his parishioners be\n",
      "in the least abated towards him; and all they say of him will _only_\n",
      "be, _poor man_! what pity that such a good-natured good sort of a man\n",
      "should have such a sad wife. But do I think Mr. _C._ will act in this\n",
      "manner? _No_, certainly I _do not_. I verily believe, from what you\n",
      "yourself have said of him, that he intends to prove himself a true\n",
      "minister of Christ, that he will _boldly_ and _earnestly_ call sinners\n",
      "to repentance, and that his life and conversation will be wholly\n",
      "agreeable to his preaching. And if this is the case, though you were\n",
      "never to see Mr. _W._ again, Mr. _C._ would be called a _Methodist_,\n",
      "the greatest part of his parishioners would cry out against him, and in\n",
      "all probability their generosity towards him would greatly decrease. So\n",
      "that consider the affair in what light you will, your being acquainted\n",
      "with Mr. _W._ cannot materially hurt Mr. _C._ And as to the objection\n",
      "of this acquaintance casting a reproach on your husband’s ministry,\n",
      "’tis quite _needless_; for it is not to be supposed, if Mr. _C._ be the\n",
      "man you can approve of for a husband, that you will leave his church\n",
      "when he himself preaches, to go after any other minister whatever.\n",
      "And whatever you may do at this time at proper opportunities, will I\n",
      "doubt not be so guided by _Christian_ prudence, that he, as a good and\n",
      "pious man, cannot reasonably object to it. But at present you and Mr.\n",
      "_C._ know very little of each other, and he certainly had no right\n",
      "to propose such terms as these to you, till he had given you frequent\n",
      "opportunities of judging, whether his heart and sentiments were such\n",
      "as you could entirely approve of. For my part, by the little I can\n",
      "judge in this affair, I believe him to be a good and a sincere man, and\n",
      "I heartily wish him happy, and _that with you_, if it can be brought\n",
      "about without your doing any thing to wound your conscience. In the\n",
      "mean time, whether this affair is ever concluded upon or not, frequent\n",
      "conversing together in the spirit of Christianity, may be a blessing to\n",
      "both. And how is it possible for you to give a direct answer to a man,\n",
      "till you are in some measure acquainted with him, and can judge of his\n",
      "temper and dispositions? I was quite delighted with the softness and\n",
